Information Systems Group

AboutIn today’s digitally-enabled society, where new technologies emerge and supersede each other at an ever-increasing pace, Information Systems (IS) research has never been more relevant than now. Information Systems as an academic discipline studies how information technology can deliver value to individuals, organisations and societies at large, by enabling change and innovation. At the very core of IS research is the study of the interplay between information technology, its users (people), and the operations (business processes) through which this technology is used.Cognisant of the complexity of today’s technology landscape and the profound implications this has on people, we take two complementary views on the information systems discipline:An engineering view, through which we endeavor to design, develop and evaluate novel information systems approaches, techniques and software solutions, andA managerial view, through which we strive to understand, assess and predict the use and impact of information systems on individuals, organisations and societies.Our research revolves around five key research themes:Business analytics and decision makingBusiness Process ManagementCybersecurity managementDigital healthInnovations in the digital societyWithin these themes, our application domains are manifold and varied, and include: banking and insurance, complex systems, education, healthcare, logistics and supply chain, manufacturing, non-profit, and government.The group is based in the School of Computing and Information Systems at the University of Melbourne, Australia.Ofir TurelGroup leaderReeva LedermanGroup leader

An interdisciplinary field that studies aspects related to designing, analysing, engineering, and innovating processes executed by socio-technical systems.

An interdisciplinary field of study that includes methods, processes and software systems which extract insights from various forms of structured and unstructured organisational data to enable evidence-based decision making.

Cybersecurity management is an organisation’s strategic-level capability to protect information resources and competitive advantage in a complex and evolving threat landscape.

As active partners in the University’s Health Precinct, we conduct research in digital health with a focus on health information systems and health informatics.

We examine a wide range of challenges faced in the early 21st Century by looking at how people find, evaluate and use information, especially in the context of emerging technologies, service innovation and information technology adoption.
