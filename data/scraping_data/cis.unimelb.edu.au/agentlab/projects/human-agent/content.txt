New techniques in collaborative systems for representing and reasoning about joint task achievement.Project descriptionThere is a pressing need for the development of new techniques in collaborative systems for representing and reasoning about joint task achievement in dynamic environments. As automated systems become more sophisticated in their capabilities, the design of effective interaction with human operators becomes more demanding (eg: this  Toyota Announcement).This project tackles a challenging problem faced in collaborative systems. Human-agent robotic teamwork, also termed human-automation teamwork, involving teams comprised of software agents, robots and humans, is increasingly being exploited to carry out tasks such as remote management of air or ground vehicles, and robot-assisted search and rescue operations. Such use of software assistants and physical robots to support human activities will increase in coming years. When action outcomes can be uncertain, successful collaborative activity cannot be fully pre-scripted, but must allow for adjustment as events unfold.The goal of this project is to discover new algorithms and software prototypes that will support the development of human-automation teams that can coordinate and collaborate in fast changing task environments.Research demosEpistemic planningMulti-agent epistemic planning with proper doxastic knowledge basesHattari websiteResearch on epistemic planning implemented in the Hattari board gameHattari VideoVideo demo of the online Hattari gameTic-Tac-Toe videoVideo of our multi-agent planner, MA-PRP, running on a Nao playing Tic-Tac-Toe against a personRelated venues and groupsJournalsJournal of Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent SystemsJournal of Human-Robot InteractionInternational Journal of Social RoboticsConferences / symposia / workshopsLorentz Workshop: To Be Announced!
