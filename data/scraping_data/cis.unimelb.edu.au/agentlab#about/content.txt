AI and Autonomy Lab, School of Computing and Information Systems, The University of Melbourne

Intelligent systems can act (semi-)autonomously, working alongside human experts to analyse and help solve complex challenges. Designing good agents needs to balance the ability of agents to work effectively with other agents and human experts to have the maximum real-world impact.

About usWe develop innovative approaches to high-level cognitive reasoning, such as performing collaborative tasks, assessing the cognitive states of other agents, and human-agent interaction.Our methods are being applied in areas such as scheduling in mine operations, disaster management, and health.The AI and Autonomy lab is based in the School of Computing and Information Systems at the University of Melbourne, Australia.

Mine planning is complex with short, medium and long-term objectives that are often competing rather than complementary

We are actively developing automated programming and planning languages for implementing and planning complex tasks robustly and efficiently in multi-agent systems.

New techniques in collaborative systems for representing and reasoning about joint task achievement.

Modern technologies can positively transform lives. Many good concepts fail, however, to have a transformative effect by not meeting the individual and emotional needs of intended users.

As AI becomes more ubiquitous, complex and consequential, the need for people to understand how decisions are made and to judge their correctness, fairness, and transparency, becomes increasingly crucial due to concerns of ethics and trust.

Improving human-agent interactions through gaze input and other collaborative modalities.
