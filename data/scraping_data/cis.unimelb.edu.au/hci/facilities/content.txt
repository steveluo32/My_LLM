Facilities: Human-Computer Interaction, School of Computing and Information Systems, The University of Melbourne

Our researchers and students have access to a number of facilities at the University that allow them to develop and run experiments to push the boundaries of human-computer interaction. Each facility is unique and together provides researchers with end-to-end research capabilities from developing and manufacturing prototypes to running interaction design experiments.

A specialist facility for usability testing and interaction research, it supports a wide range of UI/UX activities and offers access to advanced audio-visual equipment and user testing tools such as observation rooms, HD cameras, microphone arrays and eye-trackers.

A research laboratory dedicated to the exploration, design and development of novel interactions equipped with technologies such as motion-capture, AR/VR headsets, depth sensor cameras, wearables, various sensors and electronics development kits.

A workshop that has been running since 1938 that provides design consultancy and manufacturing services such as CNC machining, conventional machining, welding fabrication, 3D printing and scanning, sheet metal fabrication and plumbing.

An accessible fabrication lab located at Melbourne Connect precinct, where technology and creativity combine to design and build innovative solutions available to active Melbourne University students, academics, or Melbourne Connect tenants.
