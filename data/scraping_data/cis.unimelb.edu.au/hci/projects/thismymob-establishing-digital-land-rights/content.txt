Establishing Digital Land Rights and Reconnecting Indigenous Communities through Emerging TechnologiesProject overviewThis study is the first to apply the framework of Postcolonial Computing to guide the design and leadership of a national-scale, Indigenous-led technology development project in Australia. We aim to establish the notion of digital land rights, which asserts the right of Indigenous peoples to a safe online space that they control. Through a project to design and evaluate a mobile app, the study aims to investigate how social technology can enhance wellbeing by connecting Indigenous communities, and how we can design culturally appropriate and sensitive technologies that afford a safe refuge for Indigenous peoples and their communities.Funding source: ARC Indigenous IN170100030.

Next Steps...Our DP funding expired in 2022. In ongoing work, the knowledge and technology generated by the ThisMyMob project are being adapted to create a system, called SWAMSmob, which will support telehealth services provided by the South-West Aboriginal Medical Service who are based in Bunbury and service south-west WA. The following video from Curtin University explains this next phase of our work.Contact detailsGreg WadleyEmail: greg.wadley@unimelb.edu.au
