Mediating intimacy: Human-Computer Interaction, The University of Melbourne

Project overview Intimacy is a crucial element of domestic life, and many interactive technologies designed for other purposes have been widely appropriated for use within intimate relationships. However, there is a deficit in current understandings of how technologies are used within intimate relationships, and how to design technologies to support intimate acts.We used cultural probes and contextual interviews and other ethnographically informed techniques to investigate how interactive technologies are used within intimate relationships. From this empirical work we generated a thematic understanding of intimacy and the use of interactional technologies to support intimate acts. We used this understanding to inform the design of intimate technologies.Project teamFrank VetereMartin GibbsJesper KjeldskovSteve HowardFlorian 'Floyd' MuellerSonja PedellKaren MecolesMarcus BunyanFunding sourceSmart Internet Cooperative Research CentrePublicationsHoward, S., Kjeldskov, J., Skov, M., Garnaes, K., and Grunberger, O.
