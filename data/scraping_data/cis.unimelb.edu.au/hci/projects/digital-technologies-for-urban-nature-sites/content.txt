Digital Technologies for Urban Nature Sites

This PhD project is investigating the design and use of digital technologies for urban nature experiences, at sites such as parks, community gardens, environmental education centres, and botanical gardens.

Project overviewIn cities, sites such as parks, community gardens, environmental education centres, and botanical gardens offer opportunities to connect with nature. These spaces serve multiple purposes, providing convenient access to green areas for recreation and socialisation, promoting well-being, and facilitating scientific education. Many such sites respond to concerns surrounding the environmental crisis and about modern populationsâ€™ lack of outdoor time, especially amongst young people.As part of the increasing use of mobile, wearable, and ubiquitous computing, various digital technologies are now being integrated into urban nature spaces. These technologies include audio tours, interactive displays, navigation assistants, mobile applications for citizen science and learning, and mixed reality applications.However, the introduction of digital tools into these environments raises important considerations. Urban nature sites are seen by some as an opportunity for direct sensory experiences and a return to pre-industrial ways of engaging with nature. There are concerns that technology might disrupt authentic nature experiences.Our research focuses on understanding how digital interventions influence perceptions of nature experiences and how digital tools can be better designed and implemented to address the unique challenges and requirements of urban nature spaces. We aim to uncover insights that will guide the responsible integration of digital technologies in urban nature experiences, preserving the essence of the natural world while embracing the potential benefits that technology can bring.ContactPiumi PereraEmail: pereradilsha@student.unimelb.edu.auSupervisorsSarah Webber, LecturerWally Smith, Professor
