The Case of Smoking Cessation

Project overview Social network sites and Web 2.0 technologies generally are among the most significantdevelopments in information technology in the past decade. The aim of this projectis to extend their reach to ambivalent socialisers: groups of people that do notform spontaneously on social network sites but which might nevertheless benefitfrom online participation.We collaborate with Quit Victoria to develop an empirically derived understandingof ambivalent socialisers in the context of smoking cessation, and we will deploysocial networking technologies to illustrate the benefits of online participationsuch as social support.Quitting smoking? Try our mobile app!Do you want to try out a new app that offers stories, tips and distractions to inspire and support you in your quit attempt? We are now looking for participants who own an Internet-enabled phone and who are planning to quit (or have just quit) in order to try the app over several weeks and to comment on it in a diary and through interviews.Research teamWally SmithBernd PlodererJon PearceRon BorlandGreg WadleySarah WebberProject information Funding source ARC Linkage Project  Project time frame 2011–2014 PublicationsPloderer, B., Smith, W., Pearce, J., & Borland, R.
