Improving Vitamin D status and related health in young women: Human-Computer Interaction, The University of Melbourne

Project overviewVitamin D deficiency is:Looming as a major public health issue.Associated with risk of many chronic health conditions affecting millions of Australians, leading to considerable suffering, economic loss and premature death.An important health risk for young women: up to 50% of Australian women are below optimal vitamin D levels; however, many evidence gaps exist in this area.In Part A, we will use state-of-the-art methods to measure circulating 25 hydroxyvitamin D (25 OHD; ie: D2 plus D3 metabolites) and its association with important clinical health indices, including musculoskeletal health; mood/mental health; and allergic disease, in young women.In Part B, we will conduct the first clinical trial to assess the effectiveness and safety of a lifestyle intervention to improve vitamin D status and related health outcomes in young women.Innovative mobile and web-technologies (most piloted and operational) will be harnessed, to improve engagement, retention and data quality, and ease participant burden.This project builds on our recent highly-successful Young Female Health Initiative (YFHI) pilot study and numerous other successful studies with young women.Project teamJohn Wark (Royal Melbourne Hospital)Steve HowardNicola Reavley (School of Population Health)Marie Pirotta (General Practice and Primary Health Care Academic Centre)George Varigos (Royal Melbourne Hospital)Project information Funding source NHMRC Grant APP1049065  Project time frame 2013â€“2015 Contact detailsProf Frank VetereEmail: f.vetere@unimelb.edu.au
