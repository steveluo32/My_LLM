Human information interaction: Human-Computer Interaction, The University of Melbourne

Having the right information at the right time is key to autonomy, decision making, and modern democracy.Increasingly, though, we get our information from technological sourcesâ€”search, online news, even social media. Our group is interested in the nexus of humans, technology and information: how do people find, use and manage information, and how is this affected (positively or negatively) by technology? Our key interests are information seeking beyond search, information neutrality and mis- and disinformation, social information seeking, and the role of information in creative and innovative problem solving.

Looking at how people experience information and technology when changing their viewpoint on issues of importance to them.

This project examines multiple design and effectiveness aspects of current and future web search systems, with an emphasis on experiences that support mobility via smartphones, tablets or augmented reality systems.
