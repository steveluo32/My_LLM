Our work brings together research from human-computer interaction, robotics, and AI to develop a robotics system that adapts to humans autonomously.

Our research seeks to develop create autonomous robots that can interact in a smooth and safe way with humans.The topics we work on include, behavioural analytics to enrich human-robot interaction, personalisation, and adaptation of the interaction to maximize intended outcomes, exploring novel human-robot interaction modalities for human and robot collaborative and interactive learning.

The project explores how technologies can support novice users to train and teach an agent or robot. The team is developing novel interfaces and integrates theories from instructional sciences and gamification to allow humans to be better robot teachers.

This project investigates how robots could be designed to assist learners and patients to acquire or reacquire new skills.

This project investigates how mixed reality technology could be used to facilitate the human-robot communication looking in particular at data visualisation and robot augmented embodiment.

Our team is exploring the potential of small drones in indoor scenarios. We are particularly interested in designing social cues for safe drone navigation in domestic environments.
