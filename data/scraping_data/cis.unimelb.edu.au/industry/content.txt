Host 6–7 short meetings with a group of 4–6 students on a fortnightly basis.

Engage our students to work on a technical project of relevance to your organisation. These projects are undertaken by Masters students on campus.

An opportunity to share your organisation’s real-world knowledge with our students. We invite interested industry members to contribute their experience of the practical application of our curriculum.
