Internship: 350 hours

Our 10–15 week internship program (350 hours/3–4 days a week) allows companies to employ high-achieving Masters students on short-term contracts to assist with specific projects or assist with general workload. The student will work at your premises as if they were regular employee and you, or your staff, will supervise their daily workload. It is an opportunity for students to apply their technical knowledge to a workplace environment and to practise skills such as teamwork and project management.Host companies are required to agree to terms and conditions for each student placement by signing the University’s standard Professional Placement Letter Agreement [54kb PDF].A complete guide for industry partners is available on Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology website:Internships: industry guideOur guide for students:Internships: student guideFurther informationEmail:  engit-placements@unimelb.edu.au
