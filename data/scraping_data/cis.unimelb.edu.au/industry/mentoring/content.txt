Female Technology Mentoring ProgramJanani undertook a Female Technology Mentoring Program with Deloitte. The program gives female students the opportunity to be mentored by some of Deloitte’s most accomplished technology consulting professionals:I had the opportunity to meet highly accomplished female professionals at Deloitte and got a real world insight into what life is like as a technology consultant. I was so inspired by what I saw and heard, and since then there is no looking back.I applied for their graduate program and after attending five rounds of the selection process; I was offered a full time role in Deloitte’s Enterprise Information Management team. The mentoring program gave me so much context and insight about the organisation, which helped me a great deal while preparing for my interview process.I enjoyed the one-on-one’s with my mentor and we discussed everything ranging from big data, work-life balance to the best restaurant in Melbourne! The mentoring program gave me the opportunity to start building my professional network within Deloitte as a student.Janani Venkatachalam Analyst, Deloitte
