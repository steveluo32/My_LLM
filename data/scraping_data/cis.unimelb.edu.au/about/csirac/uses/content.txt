In the eight years of operation (about 30,000 hours of 'uptime') at Melbourne University, over 700 computing projects were processed by CSIRAC. A brief list of these projects follows:Simulations of the practical operation of the Victorian power supply system by the SECV (State Electricity Commission of Victoria).Pattern simulations for the arrangement of atoms in face-centred cubic crystals (eg: tungsten and platinum).Evaluation of the growth rate of a stand of Pinus Radiata for the Forestry Commission of Victoria.Production of Solar Position and Radiation Tables for Australian capital cities for the CSIRO Division of Building Research.Calculation of the loan repayment schedule for University staff memberâ€™s housing loans.Computation of the radiation patterns of the rhombic antennae used by the Army Signals Branch at Donnybrook.Rigid-frame and grid-frame analysis for many of the 'high'-rise buildings (to around 25 stories) built in Australia in the early 1960s.Earlier, whilst still located in Sydney, the CSIR Mk1 had been used forAnalysis of flood data for the design of dams for assembling the Snowy Mountains Hydroelectric Authority (SMHA).As you can see, the programming projects were many and varied. A large number of the major engineering projects in Australia during the 50s and 60s had a major input from CSIRAC.Not bad for a machine that was originally intended as a research computer, in order that investigation into programming techniques and electronic computer circuitry could be undertaken.The designers
