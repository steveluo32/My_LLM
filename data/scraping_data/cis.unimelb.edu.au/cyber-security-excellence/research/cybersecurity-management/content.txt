Cyber Security

Cybersecurity management is an organisation’s strategic-level capability to protect information resources and competitive advantage in a complex and evolving threat landscape. Today’s highly dynamic and fast-paced business environment shapes the way in which enterprises use their assets such as digital processes, information and IT systems to gain a competitive advantage. These assets are increasingly exposed to security threats, both external and internal, such as theft, fraud, sabotage, embezzlement, and industrial espionage. Cybersecurity management mitigates the risk exposure of organisations using a range of managerial, legal, technological, process and social controls.This interdisciplinary group of researchers focus on:Incident response and crisis managementHow organisations can adapt their defensive posture to the changing threat landscape by developing situation awareness and by learning from past experiences.Key research projectsOrganisational Learning from Incident ResponseSecurity Analytics for Situation AwarenessTomorrow’s Cyber Security FunctionSecure information and knowledge managementHow to protect information and knowledge assets in the organisational habitat such as intellectual property and trade secrets.Key research projectsLeakage of Intellectual Property and Trade Secrets in OrganisationsSensitivity Classification of Information and KnowledgeInformation Leakage through Social Media and BYODInformation and Knowledge Asset Identification for SecuritySecurity strategy and riskExploring new paradigms of risk and strategy, as well as the role and influence of decision-makers, in order to address the escalating challenge posed by sophisticated threats such as Advanced Persistent Threat (APT).Key research projectsPrevention and Response paradigms in Information SecuritySecurity Analytics for Risk ManagementContingency-based Strategy Models in Information SecuritySecurity Governance ModelsInfluence of Risk Perception of the Senior Executive on Strategy-as-PracticeSecurity policy, training, and behaviourLooks broadly at the quality and effectiveness of formal and informal security controls in organisations.
