About UsOur algorithm research group aims to design algorithms and data structures that are either practical in real-world applications, or theoretically sound achieving state-of-the-art bounds, or both for solving problems in various areas in computer science, including but not limited to theoretical computer science, database and data management, information retrieval, text indexation and compression, big data analysis and artificial intelligence, and under various fundamental computational models, e.g., external memory model, streaming model, massive parallel communication model, and more.
