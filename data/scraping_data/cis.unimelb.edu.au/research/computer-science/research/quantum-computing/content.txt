Quantum Computing

About UsQuantum computing represents the next leap forward in computing.Quantum computing is a rapidly evolving area of research that has witnessed new developments in both quantum software and hardware developments.  At the School of Computing and Information Systems, we are interested in all areas of Quantum computing including Quantum machine learning, quantum Programming, algorithm design, Quantum complexity, Quantum error correction and post quantum cryptography. We work closely with the School of Physics and IBM Quantum Hub at the university.We ask big questions in a complex, interdisciplinary field requiring knowledge of not just computer science but materials science, engineering, physics and mathematics.We teach/contribute to the following subjects:MULT20015, Elements if Quantum ComputingMULT90063, Introduction to Quantum ComputingCOMP90084 Quantum Software Fundamentals.
