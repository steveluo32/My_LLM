Digital Phenotyping

Project overviewDigital phenotyping is the process of using data collected from mobile devices and other digital technologies to infer information about an individual's mental and physical health. This technology can be used to track symptoms of mental health conditions, monitor medication adherence, and even predict the onset of a mental health episode. While digital phenotyping has the potential to improve and facilitate mental health care, it also raises a number of rich philosophical questions and ethical concerns.Apart from conducting digital phenotyping trials and developing associated technologies, we also have a keen interest in exploring the philosophical and ethical dimensions of digital phenotyping.PublicationsCoghlan, S., & D’Alfonso, S.
