Digital Health Ethics

Digital health ethics refers to the ethical considerations and principles that guide the development, deployment, and use of digital technology in healthcare.This includes issues such as privacy, security, data ownership, and access to healthcare information and services. Other important considerations include the potential for bias and discrimination in the design and use of digital health tools, as well as the ethical implications of using artificial intelligence and machine learning in healthcare.Ensuring that digital health technology is developed and used in a responsible and ethical manner is of paramount significance. In addition to the technical and scientific aspects of digital health, our digital health team also conducts research that explores the ethical dimensions of the systems they are developing and digital health technologies more generally.
