Digital Therapeutic Alliance

Project overviewThe therapeutic alliance (TA), the relationship that develops between a therapist and a client/patient, is a critical factor in the outcome of psychological therapy. As mental health care is increasingly adopting digital technologies and offering therapeutic interventions that may not involve human therapists, the notion of a TA in digital mental health care requires exploration. The term digital therapeutic alliance (DTA) is a broad one that can be applied to a range of types of digital mental health care or interventions, including computer-mediated teletherapy, web/mobile apps, and therapy agents driven by artificial intelligence. We were some of the first researchers to establish the notion of a DTA and have been working on conceptualisations and measures of it for several years.PublicationsTong, F., Lederman, R., D'Alfonso, S., Berry, K., & Bucci, S.
