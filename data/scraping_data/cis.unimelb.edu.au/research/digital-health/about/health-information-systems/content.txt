Health Information Systems

Much health care and health research happens in hospitals, community health and aged care organisations and other multifaceted settings where diverse people have diffuse responsibilities for dealing with a wealth of data sources, both formal and informal, increasingly digital.Work in this area aims to make sense of these multiple sources of data to provide quality, timely information to improve health outcomes. Research can enhance data quality management, data integration, data mining, human-computer interaction and workflow in existing health information systems and during the planning and implementation of new systems.Projects in this area examine the complex sociotechnical interplay of humans and systems. They focus on real-world problems to provide insight and support for processes such as bed and roster management, patient admission, handover, discharge and referral, outpatient and telehealth services, and reducing adverse events.
