It is a great opportunity to present a pertinent aspect of your research, such as a methodology or framework where visuals are needed and could be used to their full advantage. This track is particularly useful for students who would like more face-to-face interaction with the audience. This could be useful for networking, e.g., with industry guests in attendance.Submit a 100 to 200-word abstract and your poster (A1, pdf).Poster + DemonstrationIf you would like to present material in addition to your poster, the poster + demonstration stream provides an opportunity to showcase your research in both a poster and interactive format. Presenters can engage attendees in technologies relevant to their research and better convey the user perspective. This track is especially helpful for obtaining feedback about the design, implementation, and interactivity of a proposed system or technology.Submit a 100 to 200-word abstract, your poster (A1, pdf) and a list of required items for your demonstration.TemplatesDownload the author kit (templates)EasyChair tipsIf you don't already have one, create an EasyChair account using your University of Melbourne student emailGo to the EasyChair CIS-DC conference web page: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cisdc2023Choose your preferred trackUnder "Author" click "Add yourself" for the first authorComplete the form and submitResourcesPosters from previous colloquiums: Poster 1 and Poster 2.Proceedings from the 2017 CIS-DC Colloquium can be found here.Developing an academic writing style: https://students.unimelb.edu.au/academic-skills/explore-our-resources/developing-an-academic-writing-styleCreating effective presentations: https://students.unimelb.edu.au/academic-skills/explore-our-resources/speaking-and-presenting/effective-presentationsPoster design tips: https://students.unimelb.edu.au/academic-skills/explore-our-resources/speaking-and-presenting/designing-a-poster
