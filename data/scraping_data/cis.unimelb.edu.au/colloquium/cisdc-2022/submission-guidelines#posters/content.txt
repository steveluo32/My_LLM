Abstract and Paper SubmissionEvery submission requires both an abstract submission and a corresponding paper submission. The chosen platform for submissions and the peer reviewing process is EasyChair. To submit, you will need to first create an account on EasyChair using your UniMelb student account. The EasyChair submission conference link is: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cisdc2022Submit a 400 words abstract and a short paper (1-2 pages, pdf).Poster, Demonstrations and 3 Minute Research SubmissionThese tracks requires both an abstract submission and a corresponding material submission. Follow submission instructions described under Abstract and Paper Submission.3 Minute ResearchThe three-minute research is a presentation track where GR’s consolidate their ideas and research discoveries so they can present a clear, concise, yet engaging presentation of their research project in three (3) minutes to a non-specialist audience.Submit a 200 words abstract and your slides (including a pdf export).PostersThe poster track involves the submission of a poster outlining your academic work along with a showcase during the CIS-DC where you will present your work. It is a great opportunity to present a pertinent aspect of your research, such as a methodology or framework where visuals are needed and could be used to their full advantage. The Poster track would be particularly useful for students who would like more face-to-face interaction with the audience. This could be useful for networking, e.g., with industry guests in attendance.Submit a 400 words abstract and your poster (A1, pdf).DemonstrationsWe are also encouraging live demonstrations if this is possible with your research.
