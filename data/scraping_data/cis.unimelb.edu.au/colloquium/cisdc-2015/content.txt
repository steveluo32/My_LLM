Presentation titleSystem U to Watson Personality Insights: The Transformation of A Research Project into a Commercial OfferingAbstractThe measure of any successful researcher is the impact of their work. This impact can be measured scientifically through the number of citations of their published journal and conference papers, or, just as importantly in IBM Research, measured by the revenue it generates after being transformed into a commercial offering.This presentation will introduce IBM Research - Australia and describe the transformation of a research project, called System U, into a commercial offering, called Watson Personality Insights.BiographyDr Anna Phan began her studies with a double degree in software engineering and science at The University of Melbourne, pursuing her competing interests in programming and science. Science won initially, and Anna continued studying particle physics and was involved in the ATLAS experiment at CERN that discovered the Higgs Boson. However, her interest in information technology triumphed and she is now a manager at IBM Research — Australia, leading the physical modelling and data analytics team.Organising CommitteeFarzad KhodadadiFarah Zaib KhanMohadeseh GanjiNick DowningYali ZhaoYang LeiCarlos Andres Agudelo-Serna
