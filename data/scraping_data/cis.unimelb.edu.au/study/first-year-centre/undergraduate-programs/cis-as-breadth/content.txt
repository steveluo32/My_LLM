CIS subjects make excellent breadth subjects for students outside of the Bachelor of Science. Our first year subjects are designed to accommodate students with any level of prior experience, and will equip you with essential skills for the 21st-century workplace.

Foundational Subjects Whether you plan to pursue a career in computing or simply want to understand the technology that surrounds us, these courses will provide you with solid foundations in programming and algorithms that can be applied to any career.Our introductory subject, Foundations of Computing, is designed to accommodate students with no prior programming experience and teach them to become proficient programmers over the course of the subject.Students with some prior experience are welcome to apply for the Programming Proficiency Test, which will enable them to enrol directly in the following subject, Foundations of Algorithms, if passed.Completion of Foundations of Computing is generally required to enrol in Level 2 and 3 subjects, and Foundations of Algorithms is an additional prerequisite for many subject tracks.

Further StudiesAfter completing our foundational subjects, Level 2 and 3 subjects become available. These allow students to begin specialising in certain areas of Computing and IT, and a full list of subjects offered within the school of CIS can be found at the link below.CIS Subjects in the Subject HandbookWhen planning your course around breadth subjects in CIS, remember to check the prerequisites in the Eligibility and Requirements section of the subject's handbook page. Level 3 subjects are especially likely to require completion of subjects beyond Foundations of Computing and Foundations of Algorithms.
