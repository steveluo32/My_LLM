Spatial Systems Major

Undergraduate Majors

Spatial Systems

Spatial Systems Major

The spatial systems major, available through the Bachelor of Design and Bachelor of Science, develops deep knowledge in spatial measurement and analysis in both human and natural environments. The major covers topics such as land surveying and mapping, remote sensing, geographic information systems, image processing and land administration. Subjects in this major are designed with significant hands-on, practical elements to complement the engineering and IT theory covered in the course.

Course OverviewIn the first and second years of the Spatial Systems major, students complete subjects that are prerequisites for the major. These include mathematics, foundational mapping, geographic information systems and surveying.Completion of the major in third year requires four subjects of deep and specialised study in spatial systems. The core subjects required for completion of the major are Engineering Risk Management, Imaging the Environment, Land Administration Systems, and the Digital Infrastructure Systems Capstone.More Information About the Spatial Systems MajorTo become a professionally accredited spatial engineer, students can study the Spatial Systems major in the Bachelor of Design or Bachelor of Science, then progress to the Master of Spatial Engineering.Other popular graduate pathways include the Master of Information Technology (Spatial), Master of Urban Planning, and Master of Construction Management.

  Sample Course Plan

    This course plan shows one way that a student could arrange core and elective subjects throughout the three years of their Bachelor of Science to fulfil the requirements of the Computing and Software Systems Major.

    Note that it it possible to take up to 5 breadth subjects, and to choose different electives in the elective slots that have been filled in this example.
