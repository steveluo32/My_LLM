World View Indo-Pacific
World View exists to inspire, create, and explore new perspectives for a radically improved future. We strive to use our demonstrated technology to deliver new perspectives by operating at altitudes within the stratosphere that enable the collection of high-resolution imagery and other unique data sets. We aim to inspire new perspectives through the experiences and content we create from our systems operating within the stratosphere, applying our technology to specific use cases. Finally, we believe we explore new perspectives by researching new payloads and working with customers and partners to understand how they might benefit from the use of our technology, with the goal of saving lives and averting disasters.
 
World View is positioned to fill a critical gap in the space imaging and analytics ecosystem with offerings that cannot currently be cost-effectively replicated by an unmanned aerial vehicle (“UAV”), low-earth orbit (“LEO”) satellite or geostationary (“GEO”) satellite.

World View has a demonstrated record of accomplishments in the stratospheric ballooning industry with more than 120 completed stratospheric flight operations, including flights with 4,700kg and 10,000kg payloads. World View is a vetted and trusted stratospheric operator with current and past customer relationships that include NASA, NOAA, certain U.S. Department of Defense units, U.S. Air Force, Sierra Nevada Corporation and many others. Over the longer term, future applications of World View’s technologies may allow us to access other areas of the broader space economy to include space tourism and geospatial analytics/digital products. We believe the commercial exploration of space and, in our case, the edge-of-space, represents one of the most exciting and important technological initiatives today.
