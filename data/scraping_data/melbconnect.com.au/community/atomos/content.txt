ATOMOS
ATOMOS designs pioneering products that transform the way digital film and video content are created around the world. From our range of hardware devices for monitoring and recording, easy-to-use software tools, and intelligent cloud services, we engineer best-in-class technologies and create products for the next generation of filmmakers. Through relentless innovation, we simplify your workflow. Whether you record cinema-quality footage, monitor a scene with crystal clear colour accuracy, switch between multiple cameras, or stream a live event with a portable studio, ATOMOS empowers anyone to realize the best possible version of their creative potential. In 2022 the company will take a leading role in the next era of cloud-based workflows. This new phase begins with the introduction of a new CONNECT range of hardware products and ATOMOS Cloud Studio, a set of software as a service (SaaS) tools designed to support a new generation of filmmakers and video producers. Collectively these technologies will reshape the world of production and support new forms of collaboration. They will enable filmmakers and video producers of every kind to share their work and engage directly with audiences anywhere in the world.

"As Atomos continues to grow our hardware and software services, co-locating with Melbourne Connect offers us a great opportunity to recruit and engage with engineering talent to help support our strategic plans." 
â€” Trevor Elbourne, Atomos CEO
