Melbourne Connect | Science Gallery Melbourne

Science Gallery Melbourne is the cultural anchor of Melbourne Connect. It is a living lab for exhibitions and ideas, exploring the collision of art and science. It plays a vital role in shifting our understanding of science, art and innovation.
The University of Melbourne has secured the rights to the Australian node of the acclaimed Global Science Gallery Network. One of only eight nodes worldwide, Science Gallery Melbourne involves, inspires and transforms curious minds, aged 15-25 through science and art.
Part experiment, part exhibition, the Gallery’s programs connect, engage and showcase the work of artists, scientists, researchers, industry, and a global network of collaborators.
Watch the video below to discover more about Science Gallery and learn about the three pop-up exhibitions they’ve discovered in recent years: BLOOD , PERFECTION, and DISPOSABLE.
