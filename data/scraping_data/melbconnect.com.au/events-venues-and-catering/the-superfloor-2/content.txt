The Superfloor
The 3,600sqm Superfloor sets a new global benchmark for innovation community curation and partner amenity. A dedicated collaboration space that connects the Precinct, the Superfloor is accessible to all colocated partners and has been designed by leading architect Woods Bagot, creating a space that will be at the heart of the innovation community and foster a culture of collaboration and be supported by a dedicated team of curators and connectors.
The Superfloor is open and operational between 8am and 8pm Monday-Friday and offers a range of spaces available for hire including The Forum, The Studio, and The Launchpad.
With year-round activations and events held in this space including pitches, demo days, hackathons, launches, exhibitions, skills development, social and cultural events, it is a place that brings the community together.
