New around here? Curious to know what MAP Launch is?
First off, welcome! It's great to have you stumble across our event page.
MAP, short for Melbourne Accelerator Program, is the University of Melbourne's renowned accelerator initiative. Each year, we handpick 10-11 of Australia's most high-performing and ambitious startups to join our Accelerator. But here's the kicker: MAP isn't your run-of-the-mill accelerator. We offer our founders alternative and unmatched experiences, fostering an entrepreneurial mindset, promoting accountability, and integrating them into a startup community like no other.
MAP Launch marks the beginning of our Accelerator's annual journey, serving as the grand debut for our fresh batch of 10 startups before they dive into their intensive five month program.
Get inspired, build new connections, and enjoy the vibes that our 2024 MAP Launch is set to bring.
