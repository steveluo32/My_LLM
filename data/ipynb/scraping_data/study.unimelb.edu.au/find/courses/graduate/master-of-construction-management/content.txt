          Design Your Future, Information SessionWednesday 15 May, 6pm-8pm Glyn Davis Building, Parkville Campus Join us on campus to learn more about graduate study at the Melbourne School of Design. Discover what sets us apart, the unique opportunities on offer and where a career in the built environment can take you.Register nowThe Master of Construction Management is a professional degree that will kick start your career in the construction industry or enhance your existing expertise to advance your career.You will gain the theoretical knowledge, as well as the practical skills, to manage the social, technological, financial and environmental challenges facing the construction industry today.The Master of Construction Management provides students with the possibility to organise their studies in three different areas of specialisation:BuildingThe major in building is conceived for those students who aspire to become construction/project managers and work within medium-large general construction contracting companies. It has a strong technical and management component concerned with construction planning, contract administration, and all aspects of site operations.Cost managementThe specialisation in cost management prepares students for a professional career in quantity surveying, cost engineering and cost estimating in the Australian and the International market. Its main technical component is concerned with all aspects of contractual and financial management in construction projects.Project managementThe specialisation in project management is conceived for students who have an interest in coordinating all aspects of the building procurement process on behalf of clients – either within a private project management company or within a client organisation. This specialisation is well suited to students with previous work experience in a built environment discipline. The educational focus is placed on the integration of technical dimensions and the ability to understand, foresee, evaluate and control industry contributions to a project.Some of these areas provide graduates with a solid foundation for a future career in construction, while others have been designed for students from industry to strategically develop expertise for further career development.If you’ve studied in a related discipline, you could be eligible for Advanced Standing (also known as credit or recognition of prior learning). Your course duration will be determined at the time of the application.If you’re looking for networks to help with internships and job opportunities, or the funds to help you get to Melbourne, we have scholarships and bursaries to get you connected overseas and get you to Melbourne when you can.
