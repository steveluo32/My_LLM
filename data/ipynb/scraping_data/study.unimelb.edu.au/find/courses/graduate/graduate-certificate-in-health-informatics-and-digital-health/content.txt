The core subjects provide critical grounding in contemporary health informatics knowledge and practice; design, development, and evaluation of digital health initiatives; real-time interrogation of data; and implementation of knowledge gained in rapid quality improvement cycles. These subjects provide insights to drive improvements in patient outcomes and health system performance.Varied elective subjects allow students to strengthen and complement existing skills and pursue interests aligned to preferred career pathways.
