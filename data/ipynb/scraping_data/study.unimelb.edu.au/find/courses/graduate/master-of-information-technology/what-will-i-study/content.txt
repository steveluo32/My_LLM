        Internet Technologies
       
        12.5 pts
        Chevron-down  AIMSThe subject will introduce the basics of computer networks to students through a study of layered models of computer networks and applications. The first half of the subject deals with data communication protocols in the lower layers of OSI and TCP/IP reference models. The students will be exposed to the working of various fundamental networking technologies such as wireless, LAN, RFID and sensor networks. The second half of the subject deals with the upper layers of the TCP/IP reference model through a study of several Internet applications.INDICATIVE CONTENTTopics covered include: Introduction to Internet, OSI reference model layers, protocols and services, data transmission basics, interface standards, network topologies, data link protocols, message routing, LANs, WANs, TCP/IP suite, detailed study of common network applications (e.g., email, news, FTP, Web), network management, and current and future developments in network hardware and protocols.

        Algorithms and Complexity
       
        12.5 pts
        Chevron-down  AIMSThe aim of this subject is for students to develop familiarity and competence in assessing and designing computer programs for computational efficiency. Although computers manipulate data very quickly, to solve large-scale problems, we must design strategies so that the calculations combine effectively. Over the latter half of the 20th century, an elegant theory of computational efficiency developed. This subject introduces students to the fundamentals of this theory and to many of the classical algorithms and data structures that solve key computational questions. These questions include distance computations in networks, searching items in large collections, and sorting them in order. INDICATIVE CONTENTTopics covered include complexity classes and asymptotic notation; empirical analysis of algorithms; abstract data types including queues, trees, priority queues and graphs; algorithmic techniques including brute force, divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming and greedy approaches; space and time trade-offs; and the theoretical limits of algorithm power.

        Programming and Software Development
       
        12.5 pts
        Chevron-down  AIMSThe aims for this subject is for students to develop an understanding of approaches to solving moderately complex problems with computers, and to be able to demonstrate proficiency in designing and writing programs. The programming language used is Java.INDICATIVE CONTENTTopics covered will include:
Java basics
Console input/output
Control flow
Defining classes
Using object references
Programming with arrays

        Database Systems & Information Modelling
       
        12.5 pts
        Chevron-down  AIMSThe subject introduces key topics in modern information organisation, particularly with regard to structured databases. The well-founded relational theory behind modern structured query language (SQL) engines, has given them as much a place behind the web site of an organisation and on the desktop, as they traditionally enjoyed on corporate mainframes. Topics covered may include: the managerial view of data, information and knowledge; conceptual, logical and physical data modelling; normalisation and de-normalisation; the SQL language; data integrity; transaction processing, data warehousing, web services and organisational memory technologies. This is a core foundation subject for both the Master of Information Systems and Master of Information Technology.INDICATIVE CONTENTThis subject serves as an introduction to databases and data modelling from a data management perspective. Database design, from conceptual design through to physical implementation will be covered. This will include Entity Relationship modelling, normalisation and de-normalisation and SQL. Additionally the use of databases in various contexts will be explored (web based databases, connecting programs to databases, data warehousing, health contexts, geospatial databases).

View detailed information in the Handbook  Introduction to Machine Learning 
        AI Planning for Autonomy
       
        12.5 pts
        Chevron-down  AIMSThe key focus of this subject is the foundations of autonomous agents that reason about action, applying techniques such as automated planning, reinforcement learning, game theory, and their real-world applications. Autonomous agents are active entities that perceive their environment, reason, plan and execute appropriate actions to achieve their goals, in service of their users (the real world, human beings, or other agents). The subject focuses on the foundations that enable agents to reason autonomously about goals & rewards, perception, actions, strategy, and the knowledge of other agents during collaborative task execution, and the ethical impacts of agents with this ability.  The programming language used in this subject is Python. No lectures or workshops on Python will be delivered.INDICATIVE CONTENTTopics are drawn from the field of advanced artificial intelligence including:
Search algorithms and heuristic functions
Classical (AI) planning
Markov Decision Processes
Reinforcement learning
Game theory
Ethics in AI planning

        12.5 pts
        Chevron-down  This subject aims to give you theoretical frameworks, practical insights, and preliminary skills to work in your chosen profession in contexts where determining what problem to work on is an important complement to knowing how to solve that problem.You will develop these understandings, insights and skills by working on two projects.  In the first, they will work in multi-disciplinary teams on a strategically-important innovation challenge sponsored by an industry organisation. Through that project, you will learn the “what and how” of delivering innovation-like projects – understanding the relationship between your challenge and the organisation’s strategy; designing, securing, and conducting interviews; analysing qualitative data to generate insights; ideation and creativity techniques to create value; stakeholder management; working in an intense team on an ambiguous problem; visual and oral communication.  In the second, you will develop the ability to apply to the same concepts to yourself – How will you know what you want and need?   How will you know if you need to change?  How will you innovate yourself as your interests, needs, and work world shift?   We aim for you and your team to own your project and your learning. Creating Innovative Professionals (CIP) and its companion subject, Creating Innovative Engineering ENGR90034 (CIE), are delivered by the University's Innovation Practice Program. To learn more about the Program, including the range of organizations that have participated as sponsors, examples of past projects and to hear students talk about their experiences in taking CIE/CIP, please go to the Innovation Practice Program’s website.All project sponsors will require students to maintain the confidentiality of their proprietary information. The University will require all students (except those working on projects sponsored by the University itself) to assign any Intellectual Property they create (other than Copyright in their Assessment Materials) to the sponsor of their project.
