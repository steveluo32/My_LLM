          Overview
          As we adapt to global changes that impact our cities including climate change and deepening inequality, concerns for community health and safety, and the emergence of global city-regions, planning has never been more critical.The Master of Urban Planning is a professional degree that focuses on Australian and international policy and planning pertaining to human settlements and how we cope with challenging population and environmental issues.Because practicing planners work closely with other disciplines, our interdisciplinary approach to teaching will prepare you to work effectively and collaboratively in industry.If you’re looking for networks to help with internships and job opportunities, or the funds to help you get to Melbourne, we have scholarships and bursaries to get you connected overseas and get you to Melbourne when you can.
