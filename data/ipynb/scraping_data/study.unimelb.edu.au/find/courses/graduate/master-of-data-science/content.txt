        Course overview
        
          Overview
          The Harvard Business Review has labelled data science the "sexiest job of the 21st century".If they meant that jobs in data science are increasing dramatically, that data scientists can work in fields as diverse as health, retail or ecology, and that data scientists are commanding high salaries, then they were spot on.After all, we're creating more than 2.5 exabytes of data every day. Someone needs to make sense of it all.A course tailored to youYou'll enter the Master of Data Science with a background in computer science or statistics (or both), and the course will be tailored to build your skills in the other discipline.Flexibility to follow your interestsCore subjects will give you a solid grounding in data science, so you’ll have the technological and analytical abilities that are vital for managing and interpreting large, complex collections of data.Beyond the core subjects, elective subjects give you the freedom to dive deeper into a specialist area of data science.Sharpen your skills with the capstone projectYou’ll leave the course with a major data science project to feature in your CV. In the capstone project, you’ll apply data science tools to a practical problem, working individually or as part of a team to showcase your skills.More than just technical skillsWe know that you’ll need more than technical capability to succeed in the workplace. To round out your skill set, you can choose from professional skills subjects, such as scientific communication, so you can start your data science career with confidence.If you’d like to gain more real-world experience, you can choose to complete an internship in a science or technology-related workplace for course credit.Upcoming information sessionMaster of Data Science Information SessionWhen: Wednesday 28 August, 6.00-7.00pm AESTRegister here    Related study areas  Computer science Data and analytics Data science Information technology and computer science Mathematics and statistics Science   Chevron-right
