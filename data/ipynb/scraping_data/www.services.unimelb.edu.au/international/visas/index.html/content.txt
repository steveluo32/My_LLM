Visas



If you’re completing your degree with us from overseas, on exchange, or a visiting research student, it's likely you'll need a student visa. This section will help you navigate the student visa process.

Applying for a student visa
How to apply for your first student visa.





Visas for student research visitors
Information for students enrolled at an overseas institution who wish to do a period of research related to their study at the University of Melbourne.





Overseas Student Health Cover (OSHC)
Obtaining OSHC is a requirement of your student visa. Bupa is the University of Melbourne's preferred provider, offering on-campus support and a policy designed for students.





Visas for your family
You may wish to invite family to visit you or live with you during your time in Australia.





Working on a student visa
You are allowed to work a limited number of hours while in Australia on a student visa.





Visa implications of changing your enrolment
Most changes to your enrolment will impact compliance with your visa conditions.





Renewing your student visa
While it is not possible to renew your student visa, you can apply for a new one if your current visa will expire before you can complete your course.





Updating your visa status and passport details
What to do if your visa status or passport details change before or during your time at the University.





Staying in Australia
Once you complete your studies, you may want to spend some time in Australia, whether for a holiday, to live and work, or to pursue further study.
