Abstract: While crowd workers typically complete a variety of tasks in crowdsourcing platforms, there is no widely accepted method to successfully match workers to different types of tasks. Previous work has considered using worker demographics, behavioural traces, and prior task completion records to optimise task assignment. However, optimum task assignment remains a challenging research problem due to limitations of the proposed approaches, such as lack of generalisability and the need for complex implementations. This thesis explores and discusses how we can use the crowd worker’s context and cognitive ability for effective task assignment. In particular, this thesis investigates how worker context can influence task acceptance when using different work devices”, and presents ‘CrowdTasker’, a voice-based crowdsourcing platform that can provide flexibility to crowd workers. Further, we present ‘CrowdCog’, a dynamic online system that performs task assignment and recommendation, by relying on fast-paced online cognitive tests to estimate worker performance across a variety of tasks. The proposed task assignment method can achieve significant data quality improvements compared to the baseline, where workers select preferred tasks. Findings of this thesis inform how future crowdsourcing platforms could be more beneficial to workers and task requesters alike.
