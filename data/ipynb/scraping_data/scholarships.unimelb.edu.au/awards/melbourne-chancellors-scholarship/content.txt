Recipient feedback
Receiving the Chancellor's Scholarship has given me a sense of security leading into university – I can pursue my academic goals and various interests without the added stress of finances and of an uncertain future hanging over my head. I am also very grateful for the added freedom to pursue a foreign exchange opportunity thanks to the contribution of the scholarship.
