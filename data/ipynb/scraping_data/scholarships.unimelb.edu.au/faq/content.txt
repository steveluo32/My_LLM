Scholarships FAQ


Find answers to some of the most common questions about scholarships. Our scholarship guide also provides step-by-step information on the process, from browsing what's on offer to after you apply.



Eligibility

What am I eligible for?

The University offers many scholarships, including prizes, bursaries and grants across all disciplines and study levels. To find which scholarships you may be eligible for, browse all scholarships and narrow down the results using the filters that best match your situation.



What's the difference between a scholarship, a bursary and a grant?

Scholarships are awarded based on previous merit or circumstances.Prizes are awarded for current merit or achievement.Bursaries are awarded for financial need.Grants are awarded towards education costs.



What benefits does a scholarship offer?

Scholarships for coursework students usually provide either a one-off payment, regular allowance payments for one or more years, or a tuition fee remission.Research scholarships may provide a stipend, specific allowance or tuition fee remission or offset.To find which benefits are available on a particular scholarship, browse all scholarships and refer to the benefits section of the relevant scholarship page.



Am I still eligible for scholarships if I am enrolled as a part-time student?

In most cases, you can apply for or receive a scholarship when you enrol part-time. There are possible tax implications for payments you receive while enrolled part-time. If this applies to you, you will be contacted with further information when you receive your scholarship payment, and can see the ATO website for details.If a scholarship is conditional on you maintaining full-time enrolment then this will be mentioned on the scholarship page and in the terms and conditions referred to on your offer letter.See: Manage your scholarship



I already have a scholarship. Am I eligible for other scholarships?

In general, you cannot hold two or more scholarships with similar values or purposes. Refer to your scholarship offer and conditions to see if it can be held with other scholarships, or if there are any limits on holding multiple scholarships or bursaries.If you are eligible for more than one scholarship, you will be offered or can receive the most beneficial one.






Applying

How can I apply for scholarships?

Most scholarships do not require an application. You will be automatically considered when you submit a course application or in the case of a prize, when you have completed e.g. a subject, major or year level.Other scholarships have dedicated application forms with opening and closing dates.Check the ‘Application process’ section of the scholarship that you are interested in. Browse all scholarships. If a scholarship has an automatic consideration process then we cannot accept direct applications for it.



When will I receive an outcome?

If you have been automatically considered for scholarships, you can expect to receive an outcome within four weeks of receiving an unconditional course offer.If you have submitted an application for a scholarship, please refer to the scholarship page for information about the expected outcome time.Find your scholarship.



What if I have questions about my scholarship application?

Check the scholarship page and application form for a contact email address or enquiry form. This is your first point of contact for application questions.If there is no contact information available, submit a scholarships enquiry.






Offers and acceptance

I want to accept my scholarship but it’s not working. What can I do?

If you are asked to respond to a scholarship offer via the Student Application Portal and you are having trouble accepting your scholarship, first try using another browser or device. If you are still having issues, submit a Scholarship enquiry.



Can I defer my scholarship?

Most scholarships can be deferred, if you have received permission to defer your course. If your scholarship cannot be deferred, then it will be withdrawn if you do not start your course in the year for which the scholarship was offered. Refer to your offer letter and scholarship conditions to find out whether your scholarship can be deferred.



My scholarship offer has lapsed. What can I do?

You should respond to your scholarship offer by the lapse date listed on your scholarship offer, even if you are not sure yet about accepting your course offer. If the lapse date has passed, then it is not guaranteed that the offer can be reinstated. Submit a Scholarship enquiry to discuss your case.






Receiving your scholarship

When can I expect my scholarship benefits?

The benefits for most scholarships are activated once you have accepted your offer and met outstanding conditions (e.g. enrolment in a course or subject). Payments have different pay days depending on the type of benefit.For detailed information on expected payment dates, please refer to your scholarship offer.See: About your Scholarship or Graduate research scholarships



How do I provide my bank details?

To receive scholarship payments, you need to provide the details of your Australian bank account and address via my.unimelb. You can update or check your details after you have accepted your scholarship offer.If you are currently located outside Australia and do not have an Australian bank account, you can wait until you arrive in Melbourne and activate your bank account.Fee sponsorship will be activated even if you have not provided your bank details.See: About Your Scholarship



Will my scholarship appear on my academic transcript?

Most scholarships, including bursaries and prizes, will be included in your academic transcript and Australian Higher Education Graduation Statement (AHEGS), as well as your Statement of Results. Together with your offer letter, this is sufficient to show that you are receiving a scholarship.If you require additional documentation of all awarded scholarships you may also purchase an Evidence of Scholarship Statement.



Do I need to maintain a particular grade to keep my scholarship?

Some scholarships require you to achieve a minimum average result. Your scholarship offer will state if your scholarship is subject to academic progress requirements, and which benefits are affected.If your scholarship offer does not mention any academic progress requirements then you do not need to maintain a particular grade to keep your scholarship.



Do I need to report my scholarship to Centrelink?

If you have applied for or are receiving Centrelink benefits, you are obliged to notify Centrelink of any scholarships you have received. We will not do this on your behalf, but can provide you with an evidence of scholarship letter on request.See: About your Scholarship



Is my scholarship taxable?

Scholarship payments are normally exempt from income tax if you are full-time enrolled. If you are enrolled part-time, you will need to declare any payments in your Tax Return.See: About your Scholarship



What will happen to my scholarship if I am granted a leave of absence from my course?

If you are granted leave of absence, then regular scholarship payments will be paused and the end of your scholarship will be extended by the duration of the leave.Most graduate research scholarships have limited paid leave provisions if the leave of absence is due to compassionate or compelling circumstances.See: Graduate Research Hub
