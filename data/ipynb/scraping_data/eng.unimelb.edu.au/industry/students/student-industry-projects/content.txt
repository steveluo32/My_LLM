Student Industry Projects
A guide for industry



Student Industry Projects are an opportunity for you to oversee a student, or students, designing or researching a non-critical project which, when completed, can be used by your organisation.

Student Industry Projects are unpaid projects undertaken by students in collaboration with an industry supervisor and an academic supervisor at the University. Organisations can work with an individual student or a small group, for either one or two academic semesters, depending on the project.Is a Student Industry Project right for my organisation?Student Industry Projects are an opportunity for you to oversee a student, or students, designing or researching a non-critical project which, when completed, can be used by your organisation. Projects can take place on-site at your organisation, at the University with your regular input, or a combination of both.For the EMI (Electrical, Mechanical and Infrastructure) School of Engineering Student Industry Projects, the requirements can be found here.You will develop a collaborative relationship with both the student(s) and the supervising academic but you won’t need to be involved in day-to-day supervision of the work, unless you want to. Each May and October, students can showcase their projects at our annual Endeavour event.If you are interested in taking on a student to work on day-to-day workload on-site at your organisation, our Internship program allows organisations to take students on for a 10–15 week period, with a view to deepening students’ professional workplace skills.Hosting a Student Industry ProjectStudents are normally matched to projects by the University. You can specify the type of project and number or students you wish to host and we will assign suitable students to your project.The University’s Public Liability and Professional Indemnity insurance covers the University and its students in relation to the placement.
