Harnessing mineral resources for a sustainable future.Global demand for minerals and metals is increasing, with diverse uses in construction, communication, transport and healthcare.To optimise these critical resources, we need safe and sustainable production systems with zero emissions leading to outcomes that enhance our communities and the environment.A vast array and quantity of critical minerals are required to secure a zero-carbon future.   Expanding the global supply of copper, lithium and rare earths, to name but a few, will require new innovations.Social responsibility is in the spotlight.Our research develops new mining and mineral processing technologies to reduce environmental impacts and increase the efficiency of resources extraction. We consider the whole-of-life use of minerals and the products created. Why does it matter?Many minerals and resources play a key role in technologies to de-carbonise the world’s energy and transportation sectors. The minerals in lithium batteries, for example, are critical to the mass uptake of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind.The high-capacity battery power generation and storage solutions of tomorrow rely on new energy materials, such as lithium, vanadium, nickel, cobalt and graphite.These materials need mining, processing and recycling. We need to transition from traditional ore extraction technologies and processes to more sustainable methods.How can we help your business?The University of Melbourne has a long history of collaboration with the resources sector and understands the complexities and competing priorities across the value chain.We work with explorers, miners and mining equipment, technology and service (METS) providers to develop precision technologies that offer end-to-end solutions for mining and sustainable minerals processing.We can help articulate technological problems, analyse solutions through sophisticated simulation, and create testing prototypes in our facilities and in the field.Our cross-disciplinary research teams develop new materials and life-cycle processes for the renewable energy sector. We are helping to build sustainable advanced battery industries domestically and globally.
