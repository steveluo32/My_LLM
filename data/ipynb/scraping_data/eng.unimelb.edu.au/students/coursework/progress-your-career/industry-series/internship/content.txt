“Over the final semester of my Master of Engineering, I completed an internship at Analog Devices Australia. Throughout the internship, I was able to both put my university-leant knowledge into practice and learn a variety of new industry-specific skills. I was also able to develop my confidence and professional identity by being a part of an engineering/IT workplace. Having now accepted a full-time role at the company, the internship was the perfect way to transition from student life to working life.”Master of Engineering (Electrical) Student, 2024
