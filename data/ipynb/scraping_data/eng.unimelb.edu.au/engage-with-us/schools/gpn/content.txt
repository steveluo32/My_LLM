Girls’ Programming Network







Girls’ Programming Network




Introduce your female students to computer programming with our interactive workshops as part of the Girls’ Programming Network, held on campus. This program is open to female high school students enrolled in year 7 and onwards.


The Girls’ Programming Network (GPN) is a program developed and run by girls and for girls. Managed by a group of female information technology (IT) students (both from the University of Melbourne and elsewhere), it’s for high school girls (year 7 - 12) interested in IT, particularly those interested in learning to program or improving their software development skills.One weekend day each term we run a workshop with an activity where girls can learn about an exciting topic in computer science. Topics we explore range from Cellular Automata to Artificial Intelligence.In most workshops we also look at the Python programming language. Participants will learn to program in Python and get hands-on experience writing computer programs.Attending GPN is a great way to improve girls’ programming skills, regardless of what level they are currently at.GPN will also prepare you for the National Computer Science School (NCSS) over summer.GPN is also a unique opportunity for girls to meet new friends with similar interests, find mentors, and find out about university life.If you are a UOM student interested in being a tutor email us
