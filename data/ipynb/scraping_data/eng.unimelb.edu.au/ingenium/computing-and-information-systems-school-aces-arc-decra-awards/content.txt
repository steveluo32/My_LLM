Computing and Information Systems School aces ARC DECRA awards 
By early 2024, ten researchers from the School of Computing and Information Systems (CIS) will be funded through the prestigious Australian Research Council (ARC) Discovery Early Career Researcher Awards (DECRAs). A record number of awardees, and a proud moment for the School. The DECRA scheme is a highly competitive Australian research grant awarded to outstanding early career academics. The scheme provides three-year grants for up to 200 early career researchers across the country each year – supporting research and innovation that will result in new technologies, products and ideas, job creation, economic growth, and improved quality of life.Head of School, Professor Uwe Aickelin, said that three CIS researchers have recently been announced as DECRA recipients for 2024, with another seven in the School already in receipt of a current DECRA. Dr Melissa Rogerson, Dr Feng Liu and Dr Naveed Akhtar, who is joining CIS in October, are the newest CIS researchers to receive DECRAs, to start their projects in 2024.The ten DECRA researchers in the School of Computing and Information Systems. "What a tremendous success story for CIS," Prof Aickelin said. “These accomplishments reflect our culture of excellence and our commitment to recruiting and supporting the most promising researchers and innovative thinkers dedicated to solving the most pressing challenges. CIS will do its best to support everyone. The future is looking very bright.”The ten DECRA researchers in the School of Computing and Information Systems are:Dr Melissa Rogerson’s project titled “Hybrid Technologies for Tabletop Games”, seeks to create hybrid board games by integrating modern sensors and technologies into traditional games. By adopting a human-centered design process. This project is expected to foster hybrid-play technologies called “reusable components”.Dr Feng Liu’s project, “Trustworthy Hypothesis Transfer Learning” outlines a reliable framework for handling a variety of heterogeneous transfer learning scenarios. The project aims to improve the reliability of machine learning and safety learning.Dr Naveed Akhtar’s project, titled "Glass-box Deep Machine Perception for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence”, attempts to develop innovative approaches to make deep learning technology, which is the core of AI, transparent and understandable. This could potentially enable humans to comprehend a system's thought process.Dr Lea Frermann’s project "Identifying Biases in News Using Models of Narrative Framing" is seeking to create tools that can analyse news items that are based on a one-sided approach by using cutting-edge language processing techniques. This project seeks better ways to provide Australians with a balanced, two-sided perspective of news items and create awareness about biased news reporting.Dr Renata Borovica-Gajic’s project "From Data to Fast Insights: a Database System for Seamless Data Exploration" intends to create a platform allowing users to collaboratively explore hidden patterns in data without having a specific goal in mind. This freely accessible platform aims to benefit Australian businesses and accelerate scientific advancement in the data-driven global market.Dr Thuan Pham Pham’s project, entitled "Effective Integration of Human and Automated Analyses for Security Testing”, seeks to improve existing automated security testing methodologies and find more security flaws within limited time frames. This project aims to help prepare upcoming generations of software engineers to create systems that are security-critical for a better future.Associate Professor Sarah Monazam Erfani’s project "Making Anomaly Detection Interpretable and Actionable in Hostile Environments" seeks to improve the capabilities of anomaly detection for better recognition of danger in cyber security. The project aims to foster support for global developments in cyber security.Dr Patanamon Thongtanunam’s project "Data-Driven Code Reviews for Cost-Effective Software Quality Assurance" is using data-driven recommendations to develop cutting-edge approaches for software engineers to guarantee top quality software systems at the lowest possible cost. This project is anticipated to produce systems that offer helpful suggestions, new concepts and methods for effort prioritisation.Dr Bach Le’s project "Practical Automated Software Bug Fixing via Syntactic and Semantic Analyses", aims to further the use of software that automates bug fixing and has lately gained industry acceptance. Through automated feedback generation, this project will improve the quality of education for students who are interested in coding and assist the software industry in providing customers with high-quality, dependable and safe software.Dr Wafa Johal is using instructional techniques and gamification to solve the issue of enabling beginners to train robots on complicated tasks. The results are anticipated to include new techniques for trainers to analyse robot learning and enhance feedback and engagement, with the goal of achieving better human-robot interaction.   Find out more here: https://rms.arc.gov.au/RMS/Report/Download/Report/a3f6be6e-33f7-4fb5-98a6-7526aaa184cf/252
