Communicate openly

Telstra Creator Space is a collaborative environment, one where you're encouraged to work with others to innovate. A key part of this is communication. Introduce yourself to other users and the Telstra Creator Space team members.Our team members have a wealth of knowledge they are willing to share to support you in your making so please reach out if you're unsure of anything.Ask first:If you’d like to bring in your own materials, such as paints and adhesives, as, in the interests of everyone’s safety, certain hazardous materials are banned.If you don’t know the right tool or material to use, or what’s best to shape your material. For example, treated pine cannot be cut using the laser cutter as it is hazardous.If in doubt about anything at all.Tell us:About any near miss or injury occurring in Telstra Creator Space.If there are any issues or breakages of tools and equipment.What you think - feedback is important to keep the space meeting your needs.We can’t maintain the safest possible environment for everyone without your help.




MaterialsA basic inventory of materials is provided by the Faculty of Engineering & IT for project use. We encourage you to prototype your designs in drawing or CAD before physical prototyping.If you are bringing in your own materials, please consult the Telstra Creator Space accepted and banned materials list. If your material is not listed, please ask a staff member.Depending on the project, there are various ways to source your materials. The following table provides an overview of how to source materials for various types of projects.Project typeHow to source materialsNotesCourseworkSource via your Subject CoordinatorPrototyping materials and offcuts in Telstra Creator SpaceGuidance to be provided via your subject coordinator.CapstoneSource via Student Budget submissionPrototyping materials and offcuts in Telstra Creator SpaceCheck-in with a Telstra Creator Space team member for any other materials**To access ‘in kind’ materials, groups are encourage to attend a Design Fabrication Review with a Telstra Creator Space team member to understand your needs.FEIT Clubs and SocietiesSelf-Source through university procurement processPrototyping materials and offcuts in Telstra Creator SpaceCheck-in with a Telstra Creator Space team member any other materials, and those you bring in yourself.We encourage teams to attend a Design Fabrication Review to help fabricate it to suit your needs.PersonalPrototyping materials and offcuts in Telstra Creator Space and/orCheck-in with a Telstra Creator Space team member any other materials, and those you bring in yourself.We encourage you to attend a Design Fabrication Review to help fabricate it to suit your needs.



 Frequently asked questions




What are prototyping materials and off-cuts?

What’s an off cut?An off cut is piece of waste material that is left behind after cutting a larger piece.Re-purposing rejects, seconds and factory off cutsFrom time to time, Telstra Creator Space sources a variety of items from Reverse Art Truck to assist in topping up our 'prototyping materials' for open ended projects.What’s in your ‘prototyping materials’ collection?It’s random and can change daily! For example, we could have PVC Pipes, string, or small bits of dowel. It's best to come in and check it out.How you can contributeTurn your waste, off cuts into something usable for someone else by placing it in the signed Prototyping materials and off cuts locations in Telstra Creator Space.
