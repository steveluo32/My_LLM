 Student experience   Home About us Chevron-right   Student experience Chevron-right  Melbourne Curriculum – immerse yourself in a different way of thinkingThe University of Melbourne’s degrees work a bit differently to those at most other Australian universities. They’re similar to those offered by many top institutions overseas in that you’ll start with an undergraduate degree, and can then choose to specialise at graduate level.Why? We want you to create your own study path, with the power to choose your own direction and explore new options along the way. This is important in a world where careers are changing fast and employers value independent thinking.Few people graduating today will stay in the same industry forever. With our degrees, you can build the right skills to adapt and to change successfully.Explore course options Career outcomes – Melbourne graduates 2017 career outcome survey of graduates three to five years after graduating 97% of graduates from bachelors degrees are in employment Our graduates work across a diverse range of industries in the private, government and non-profit sectors 89% of graduates enjoy the work they do 87% of graduates feel their work makes a positive contribution to the community Site footer
