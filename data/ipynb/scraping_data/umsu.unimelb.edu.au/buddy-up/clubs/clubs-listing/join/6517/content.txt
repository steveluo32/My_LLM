Competitive Programming Club

Organise programming competitions, tutorials on algorithms and data structures, and industry events.


 
The Competitive Programming Club is about doing fairly difficult problems within fairly short time limits. Our focus is contests such as the ACM ICPC, VCPC, Google Codejam, and Facebook Hacker Cup.
We have weekly meetings where we practice problems, discuss algorithms, cry over the parts we didn’t understand, figure things out, and celebrate with free pizza.
If you think you’re the next Zuckerberg, this is not the club for you. If you want to be the next Zuckerberg then this is the club for you. Seriously though, succeeding here can greatly increase your prospects for employment as interview questions are pretty similar to competitive programming questions.
All ability levels are welcomed because everyone is going to struggle.
Club Aims:

To improve the ability of our members in implementing algorithms using programming languages such as C++ and Java.
To increase the participation and performance of students at Unimelb in computer science (algorithms and math) based programming competitions.
To host computer science based programming competitions at the University of Melbourne.
To provide a forum for the discussion of theory and applications of algorithms.
To help students meet other students who are interested in computer science based programming competitions and thus form teams in order to enter said competitions.
