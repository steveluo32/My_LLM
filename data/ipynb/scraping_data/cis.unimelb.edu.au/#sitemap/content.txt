The School of Computing and Information Systems is an international research leader in computer science, information systems and software engineering. We are focused on delivering impact in the following key areas:




Research themes




Artificial intelligence
Our researchers address many different approaches to AI, encompassing deep learning, data mining, machine learning, natural language processing, and agent-based systems.






Computer science
Current areas of excellence include programming languages, algorithms, distributed computing, and cybersecurity and cryptography.






Human-Computer Interaction
We study, teach and are fascinated by issues arising from humans interacting with emerging technologies.






Information systems
The study of the interplay between information technology, its users (people), and the operations (business processes) through which this technology is used.






Research centres




Academic Centre of Cyber Security Excellence (ACCSE)
Our research capability is focused on key challenges, including detecting attacks in large, complex systems, using formal methods to design platforms that are resilient to attack, designing robust controllers for critical infrastructure, and providing a legal framework for the governance of cyber operations that span a range of jurisdictions.






ARC ITTC in Optimisation Technologies, Integrated Methodologies and Applications (OPTIMA)
Training a new generation of industry practitioners and young researchers to build a highly skilled workforce, vanguarding the uptake of advanced optimisation technologies to support industrial transformation.






ARC Training Centre in Cognitive Computing for Medical Technologies
The Centre is aimed at creating a workforce that is expert in developing, applying and interrogating artificial intelligence applications in data-intensive medical contexts, to facilitate the next generation of data-driven and machine learning-based medical technologies.






Centre for Artificial Intelligence and Digital Ethics (CAIDE)
Facilitating cross-disciplinary research, teaching and leadership on the ethical, regulatory and legal issues relating to Artificial Intelligence (AI) and digital technologies.






Centre for Digital Transformation of Health
Health informatics and digital health are a recurring theme within all the School’s research areas. We specialise in health data analytics; personal technologies; and IT systems processes and management.
