Natural Language Processing


Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. We develop algorithms and computational models to analyze and process large volumes of natural language data in order to extract meaning and insights from text, speech, and other forms of human communication.

About UsArtificial intelligence, or AI, is increasingly being integrated into our everyday lives. They are in our smartphones (e.g. Siri), facial recognition system in Melbourne Airport, automatic captions on YouTube, and translations on Facebook, just to name a few examples. But how can we make AI truly understand human language? This is an important question, because language is uniquely human — it defines us and our intelligence. Through developing AI that understands language, our research marches one step closer to unlocking the mysteries of our language faculty.
