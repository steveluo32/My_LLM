‘Competent’ crim could evade Australia’s encryption laws, researchers say

                            “If it is possible to construct a plausible strategy that the adversary could use, we should assume that such a strategy will at some point be adopted, and as such, any gains claimed by the [legislation] will be lost,”

Two data points enough to spot you in open transport records

                            Last year, 15 million partially redacted public transport passenger details were posted online. It took researchers very little time to re-identify themselves and others, highlighting a risk to privacy.

                            New legislation aims to expose the communications of serious criminals, but it might undermine our security too

The key to unlocking your privacy

                            We’re being asked to provide more and more information about ourselves online, including in the recent New Zealand census – but should we trust assurances that our privacy is closely guarded?

                            In late 2016, doctors’ identities were decrypted in an open dataset of Australian medical billing records. Now patients’ records have also been re-identified - and we should be talking about it
