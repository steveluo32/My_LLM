Co-Creating Innovations in Digital Storytelling with Older Adults
A new grant to Associate Professor Jenny Waycott, Dr Melissa Rogerson, Professor Martin Gibbs and Dr Lucy Sparrow from the HCI group aims to explore the digital stories of older adults.Later life can be a time of considerable change, creating challenges for social wellbeing not just in terms of staying connected to family and friends but also in terms of staying connected to a sense of self. Retirement, bereavement, and declining health and mobility lead to changes in people’s personal and professional roles, established over many years, and can hide their identities as people who live rich, full, and eventful lives.“In order to ensure there is a place for every story, we must ensure that all people can be storytellers”- Revive: Australia's Cultural Policy for the next five years. 2023Autobiographical storytelling has been shown to increase community involvement, reduce isolation, promote communication and respect, diminish social barriers, give voice to marginalized groups, improve happiness and wellbeing  and enable people to remain connected with their younger selves. This Australian Research Council-funded three-year project (DP240102799) will explore how new and emerging technologies can be used to create digital life stories that are interactive and playful, supporting older adults in aging well by supporting social and cultural participation.Specifically, the project aims to:Examine how older adults create and share their stories and assess the role of technologies in facilitating social interactions based on those stories, to identify opportunities for innovation in this area.Work with older adult participants to co-design innovative forms of digital storytelling, focusing on hybrid games, augmented and virtual reality, and AI-enabled storytelling, and identify the social benefits, ethical challenges, and sociotechnical barriers that each approach involves.Evaluate the impact of new forms of digital storytelling in terms of the opportunities they provide for fostering interactions with a broad audience, facilitating social connectedness, and enhancing social wellbeing.Create guidelines for the future design and use of interactive and innovative digital storytelling programs to enable all older adults to become storytellers and to encourage diverse audiences to engage with those stories.Up to four Research Scholarships are available for graduate researchers associated with this project. For more information: https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/opportunity/1286-co-designing-augmented-and-virtual-reality-storytelling-with-older-adultsAbout the teamAssociate Professor Jenny Waycott is internationally recognised for her work on the design and use of emerging technologies for social enrichment in later life. She has appeared in numerous media interviews, been invited to speak at the National Ageing Research Institute Annual Symposium, and has participated in public panel discussions on technology and ethics, and technology in aged care.Dr Melissa Rogerson is internationally recognised for her research into boardgame play and hybridity, and has completed over 120 media interviews. She is interested in exploring how telling and experiencing people’s life stories can be fun and playful, and in how we can use physical pieces like cards as a gateway to people’s stories.Professor Martin Gibbs has an abiding research interest in communities, technologies, and everyday life. A member of the University of Melbourne’s DeathTech research team, he is currently investigating how people use interactive technologies such as video games, community networks, and mobile phones for convivial and sociable purposes in diverse situations.Dr Lucy Sparrow is an Associate Lecturer and early-career researcher, with an interest in the ethics of multiplayer gameplay and design. She has written for Wired Magazine on the ethical design of the metaverse and has been invited to share her research with numerous media outlets, podcasts, and at public-facing panels.
