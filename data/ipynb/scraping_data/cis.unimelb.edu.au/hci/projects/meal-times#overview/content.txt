Exploring natural user interfaces during meal times

On this pageProject overviewProject teamContact detailsPublications
 Project overviewThis project investigates the everyday interactions of family uses of technology around mealtimes and explores how family members configure their dinner space and the technologies within it. The researchers are seeking to understand how technologies are used and negotiated by family members and the influence of technologies during these interactions.Recent technological advancements in digital devices have given people more access to things such as photos, videos and games on their handheld mobile devices and tablets. This project is exploring how the devices contribute to both positive family interactions and the tensions that digital media can bring about in these situations during family meals.The project aims: to understand the role of everyday technologies during family mealtimes, to explore technology usage in the home during meals, and to design a NUI technology using gesture or voice to support naturally occurring social interactions during our family mealtimes.Project teamHasan Shahid Ferdous, PhD Candidate, Microsoft Research Centre for SocialNUI, The University of MelbourneFrank Vetere, Professor, The University of MelbourneBernd Ploderer, Lecturer, Queensland University of Technology & Honorary Fellow, The University of MelbourneKenton O’Hara, Researcher, Microsoft Research, Cambridge, UK & Principal Fellow, The University of MelbourneRobert Comber, Lecturer, Open Lab, Newcastle University, UKContact detailsHasan Shahid Ferdous
