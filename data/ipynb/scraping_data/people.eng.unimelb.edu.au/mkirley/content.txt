 Research Interests 

			My primary area of expertise is positioned at the intersection of artificial intelligence, machine learning and data science, with a strong emphasis on evolutionary computation.  I have made a significant contribution to research focused on the design of data-driven algorithms for optimisation and decision-making. Beyond established boundaries and discipline norms, I collaborate with both industry and university partners to find innovative solutions for complex social-technological problems.
			
			


			I am an Associate Editor for the leading journal  IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation.
