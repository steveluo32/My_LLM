Research Activities & Interests

Adrian Pearce is a Professor in the School of Computing and Information Systems at the University of Melbourne. He conducts research in automated planning and scheduling and he has contributed deeply in research on reasoning about actions within the field of artificial intelligence. 
His research has improved the efficiency and robustness of a range of applications including production scheduling for manufacture, cognitive robotics for trusted autonomous systems and multi-agent systems, supply chain logistics for sustainable resources, and  improved decision making for autonomous analysts.
Adrian is a member of the AI and Autonomy Agent Lab, part of the Artificial Intelligence group in the School. 


Together with his colleagues, Adrian has made fundamental breakthroughs which facilitate collaborative constraint and resource optimisation for autonomous systems over complex supply chain networks. This involves satisfying constraints, such as resource or processing capacities, while meeting temporally extended goals, such as maintenance constraints. More productive and sustainable manufacturing and scheduling algorithms have resulted. Algorithms for cognitive robotics and 
decision making for autonomous analysts have also been developed which facilitate improved human-robot interaction, meeting both human constraints (faster than human thought, nested reasoning) and robot constraints (dealing with irreducible uncertainty and incompleteness). 
His research interests include
 Reasoning about action and change (the situation calculus, classical planning, generalized planning & reinforcement learning)
 Strategy synthesis (game structures - linear temporal logic & mu calculus)
 Introspective reasoning (theory of mind (ToM) reasoning - epistemic logic with nested beliefs)
 Contextual reasoning and ontology adaptation (constructive mathematics - intuitionistic logic, higher order type theory)
 Discrete and continuous optimization (mathematical programming - dual decomposition, MIP & SAT)

Biography

Prof. Pearce completed a BSc (Hons. first class) in Computer Science at The University of Melbourne and a PhD in Computer Science (APAI Award) at Curtin University in Perth. He completed a Postdoctoral Research Fellowship before joining Curtin University as a Lecturer. He has been at the University of Melbourne since 2000 where he is presently a Professor of Computer Science and Information Systems and the Deputy Head of School (Engagement). He received the Erasmus Mundus Academc Scholar Award in 2014 and was Visiting Academic at Free University of Bosen Bolzano in 2014 and Sapienza University of Rome in 2009 and 2014. He received Outstanding (Best Paper) award at the International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling (ICAPS) in 2015. He regularly serves on the Senior Program Committees of the International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI), the International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling (ICAPS), the International Conference on Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KR), the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI), and the International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS).
