Potential PhD students

My group is looking for PhD students to work with us. You need to have strong technical skills, and be motivated to build novel interactive technologies that better understand and better respond to humans.
Please have a look at my research and publications pages to get an understanding of the research we do. Most recently, I launched the initiative known as the Smart Hospital Living Lab.
 If you send me an email regarding doing a PhD, please include your CV, transcripts, and a summary of the kind of research you want to do.
