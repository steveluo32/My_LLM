  Understanding of human language by computers has been a central goal of
  Artificial Intelligence since its beginnings, with massive potential to
  improve communication, provide better information access and automate basic
  human tasks. My research focuses on technologies for automatic processing of
  human language, with several applications including automatic translation.
  My core focus is on probabilistic machine learning modelling
  of language applications, particularly handling uncertain
  or partly observed data and structured prediction problems.

July 2022: Nitika Mathur awarded CORE dissertation award
February 2022: Appointed Director of the ITTC on medtech, taking over from Tim Baldwin
July 2020: Nitika Mathur was awarded a best paper at ACL 2020 (honorable mention), for Tangled Up in BLEU - Reevaluating the Evaluation of Automatic Machine Translation Evaluation Metrics
October 2019: I am travelling to Hong Kong for EMNLP, to present two papers in the main conference and two workshop papers.
September 2019: I will serve as PC chair for EMNLP 2020, alongside Yang Liu and Yulan He.
July 2019: The group has papers at ICML, WWW, NAACL, ICASSP and ACL (x3).
