The Smart Hospital Living Lab is an umbrella program involving multiple technology projects at the University of Melbourne in partnership with hospitals and industry. The main purpose of the lab is to improve how hospitals run. We strive to turn ideas into practical applications through quick prototyping and iteration. The lab develops technology with two objectives:
Improve hospital safety
Improve the safety of hospital operations, e.g. by reducing medication errors.
Improve hospital logistics
Improves the logistics and operations of hospitals, e.g. through improved patient tracking.

The lab is based in the School of Computing at the University of Melbourne. Our technological expertise that spans three key aspects of ubiquitous computing and human-centred design:


Interactive Systems: Development of interactive systems through software and hardware development.
Intelligent Sensing: Use of sensors, machine learning, and actuators, to develop systems that react intelligently to human behaviour.
Real-world deployments: Expertise with real-world deployments in hospitals and “in-the-wild” settings.



In a Living Lab, an iterative process is followed to identify and solve problems.
A key characteristic of our work is that we adopt a “Living Lab” approach. This means that the work is closely situated in hospitals, where we are embedded with the stakeholders and ultimate users of our work. Additionally, we work with stakeholders to clearly identify the problem that we seek to solve, and following an exploration process we then prototype, deploy, and evaluate the technology in its intended environment. This cycle of activities repeats continuously, each time improving some aspect of the technology we are developing.

Reliable Operating Theatre
Tracking staff and patients in the operating theatres, to ensure surgeries start on time. This project uses low-engergy beacons handed out to staff and patients.
 


Smart Pillbox
Developing a pillbox that uses spectroscopy to identify which pills are placed on it. This project aims to reduce medication errors.
 


Prosthesis Fitting and Fabrication
Innovating the process of prosthesis fabrication using 3D scanning and printing technologies to reduce fabrication time and costs, and enhance patient care.
 


Smart IV Line
Development of 3D-printed clamp for IV lines. Using spectroscopy, it verifies in real-time the liquids inside the IV line. This project aims to reduce medication errors.
 


Handwash Monitoring
Developing sensing technologies that can monitor how well people wash their hands, and whether they wash their hands at the right time.
 


Augmented Surgery
Using augmented reality to improve the experience of surgeons during operations, and particularly to enhance the education of trainee surgeons.
 


Predicting Emergency Admissions
Improving our ability to predict how many people visit a hospital’s Emergency Department, based on contextual and environmental factors.
 


Smartphones for Science
Developing smartphone software to monitor patients’ behaviour and lifestyle in and out of the hospital.
 


Proactive smart speakers
Developing proactive smart speakers for chronic disease management.

Since 2020, the Smart Hospital Living Lab is part of the NHMRC Centre for Research Excellence in
Digital Technology to Transform Chronic Disease Outcomes.
