User Interface Development (INFO20005)Undergraduate level 2Points: 12.5On Campus (Parkville)You’re viewing the 2024 Handbook: 20242023202220212020201920182017Or view archived HandbooksView full page About this subject OverviewEligibility and requirementsAssessmentDates and timesFurther informationTimetable (login required)(opens in new window)Contact informationSemester 1 greg.wadley@unimelb.edu.auOverviewAvailabilitySemester 1FeesLook up feesA crucial skill in developing interactive systems is building clear and well-designed user interfaces across a range of technologies. In this subject, students will learn how to design and build user interfaces. The subject will introduce methods, techniques, and principles of visual communication applied to the design of user interfaces. Using state-of-the-art tools, students will iteratively design and prototype a novel user interface, going from concept to implementation through increasing levels of fidelity. Around this process students will learn how to iteratively translate requirements and intentions into design constructs and working interface prototypes.Intended learning outcomesOn completion of this subject, students are expected to be able to:Apply the elements of visual design to the design of graphical user interfacesUnderstand the nature of iterative design and be able to plan and manage such processes around real-world design constraintsCreate user interface prototypes at different levels of fidelity, from low-fidelity paper prototypes to high-fidelity interactive mock-upsImplement user interface designs into working systems built with digital technologies.Generic skillsThe capacity to solve problems, including the collection and evaluation of informationThe ability to communicate designs and design thinkingWritten and oral presentation skillsNext: Eligibility and requirementsLast updated: 2 August 2024
