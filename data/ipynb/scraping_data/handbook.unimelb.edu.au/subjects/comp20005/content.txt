Many engineering disciplines make use of numerical solutions to computational problems. In this subject students will be introduced to the key elements of programming in a high level language, and will then use that skill to explore methods for solving numerical problems in a range of discipline areas.
INDICATIVE CONTENT

Algorithmic problem solving
Fundamental data types: numbers and characters
Approximation and errors in numerical computation
Fundamental program structures: sequencing, selection, repetition, functions
Simple data storage structures, variables, arrays, and structures
Roots of equations and of linear algebraic equations
Curve fitting and splines
Interpolation and extrapolation
Numerical differentiation and integration
Intended learning outcomesOn completion of this subject the student is expected to:Read and write typical small-scale numerical programs in a high-level programming languageTest and debug such programsArgue for the correctness of such programs, from both a logical point of view and a numeric-soundness point of viewDescribe the range of techniques available for creating computational solutions to scientific and engineering problems, and be able to evaluate and choose between alternative approachesDescribe and employ the general concepts that apply when computers are used to solve numerical problemsDemonstrate familiarity with the underlying theory behind a range of numerical algorithms used in scientific and engineering software packagesGeneric skillsOn completion of this subject students should have developed the following skills:
The ability to undertake problem identification, formulation and solution
Capacity for independent critical thought, rational inquiry and self-directed learning
Profound respect for truth and intellectual integrity, and for the ethics of scholarship
An ability to apply knowledge of basic science and engineering fundamentals
