This subject will introduce students to the use of imagery in the mapping of both human and natural environments. Imaging is often the most convenient way to gain spatial information about the environment, especially for large areas. Analysis and interpretation of the imagery requires understanding the principles of electromagnetic radiation, interaction of light with the atmosphere and the object surface, and how the reflected light is recorded by the imaging sensors. This enables the students to identify and analyse the image content such as different land cover types, vegetation, water, and man-made objects. Once interpreted, the information must be communicated to others, usually in the form of maps or reports. This subject builds on a student’s knowledge of the physical and built environment relevant to their discipline and allows them to interpret and communicate that knowledge. On completion of the subject students should have the skills to perform routine image analysis tasks in the workplace using industry standard software. The subject is of particular relevance to students wishing to establish a career in infrastructure engineering, civil engineering, property management, surveying, spatial information and urban planning but is also relevant to a range of disciplines where imaging should be considered.
 Intended learning outcomesOn completion of this subject the student is expected to:ILO 1 - Describe imaging techniques which allow information to be extracted from the imageILO2 - Design and create representations of spatial information extracted from image dataILO 3 - Analyse image data to monitor various environments including natural, urban, indoor, and outdoorILO 4 - Interpret image data to inform management of various infrastructures. Generic skillsOn completion of this subject students should have:
 The ability to apply knowledge of basic science fundamentals The ability to communicate effectively, not only with other scientists but also with the community at large The ability to undertake problem identification, formulation and solution The ability to function effectively as an individual and in multi-disciplinary and multi-cultural teams, with the capacity to be a leader or manager as well as an effective team member An expectation of the need to undertake lifelong learning, capacity to do so The capacity for independent critical thought, rational inquiry and self-directed learning The ability to question and critically examine established beliefs and practicesNext: Eligibility and requirementsLast updated: 8 August 2024
