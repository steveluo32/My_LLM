It provides an overview of the knowledge and tools that are essential for managing and governing digital patient record data for primary and secondary uses.
Lectures and tutorials cover four major topics: (a) Structuring health data in the era of big data in healthcare; (b) Managing and governing electronic health and medical records for safety and quality of care, including: standards, terminologies and mapping approaches applicable to clinical data and clinical documentation; (c) Structural and semantic interoperability to support data use for connected care and population health, including: Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR); (d) Managing and governing secondary use of data, including health services administration and health research, including: approaches to data privacy and security, repositories, retrieval, quality assessment, and linkage.Intended learning outcomesOn completion of this subject the student is expected to:Explain the roles of a range of information standards and protocols in ensuring the quality of patient health data Analyse relative merits of various ways in which different health information systems record patient data, and explain how such data can be mapped Demonstrate understanding of different levels of interoperability among health information systems, and explain uses of methods and tools for optimising the value of patient data through exchange between systemsCritically interpret typical requirements for retrieval and re-use of patient data for purposes other than clinical care, and propose refinements that reflect advances in approaches to digital health data analysis

Demonstrate integration and application of health data management principles in the design of new health information systems Generic skillsOn completion of this subject, students should have developed the following generic skills:
Effective communication of data requirements
