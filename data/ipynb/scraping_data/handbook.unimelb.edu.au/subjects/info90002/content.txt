The subject introduces key topics in modern information organisation, particularly with regard to structured databases. The well-founded relational theory behind modern structured query language (SQL) engines, has given them as much a place behind the web site of an organisation and on the desktop, as they traditionally enjoyed on corporate mainframes. Topics covered may include: the managerial view of data, information and knowledge; conceptual, logical and physical data modelling; normalisation and de-normalisation; the SQL language; data integrity; transaction processing, data warehousing, web services and organisational memory technologies. This is a core foundation subject for both the Master of Information Systems and Master of Information Technology.
INDICATIVE CONTENT
This subject serves as an introduction to databases and data modelling from a data management perspective. Database design, from conceptual design through to physical implementation will be covered. This will include Entity Relationship modelling, normalisation and de-normalisation and SQL. Additionally the use of databases in various contexts will be explored (web based databases, connecting programs to databases, data warehousing, health contexts, geospatial databases).
 Intended learning outcomesHaving completed this unit the student is expected to:  Understand the different technologies available to manage structured data, and the evolutionary process that led to themBe able to construct data models at the conceptual, logical and physical level from real-world, natural language requirements documents and apply data normalisation to these modelsBe able to competently use a CASE tool (computer-aided software engineering)Be competent in basic SQL and familiar with the usage of advanced SQL commandsUnderstand the need and mechanism for database transactions, including the so-called ACID propertiesBe familiar with how databases work within a larger application architectureUnderstand the relationship of database systems to a variety of fields such as data warehousing, health informatics and Geospatial applicationsSynthesize the theoretical first principles of data management, data normalisation and data modelling and apply those principles to the data needs of modern organizations.Generic skillsThe student will acquire skills in Information Modelling - a generic skill that will serve the student well throughout a career in Information Systems. Scoping within analysis is also a valuable cross-discipline skill honed during this subject.Next: Eligibility and requirementsLast updated: 26 July 2024
