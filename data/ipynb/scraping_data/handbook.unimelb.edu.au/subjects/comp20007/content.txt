Programmers can choose between several representations of data. These will have different strengths and weaknesses, and each will require its own set of algorithms. This subject will cover some of the most frequently used data structures and their associated algorithms. The emphasis will be on justification of algorithm correctness, on analysis of algorithm performance, and on choosing the right data structure for the problem at hand.
INDICATIVE CONTENT
Sample projects are: approximate string matching for a translation memory, involving sorting and comparison of dynamic programming, branch-and-bound search and brute-force search using a variety of data structures (e.g. arrays, hash tables, tries); speech synthesis based on a pronouncing dictionary and pre-prepared grapheme-phoneme alignment data, based on parsing of the alignment data, hashing of variable length n-grams, and a variety of models for predicting the phoneme(s) associated with a given phoneme sequence (e.g. a simple unigram baseline or a hidden Markov model).
Please view this video for further information: Design of AlgorithmsIntended learning outcomesOn completion of this subject, the student is expected to:Read, write and debug graph algorithms, advanced sorting algorithms, dynamic programs and greedy algorithmsRead, write and debug code using intermediate data structuresChoose between different algorithms for intermediate problems by analysing their complexityRead, write and debug typical multi-module programs in a system programming language such as CGeneric skillsOn completion of this subject, students should have developed the following skills:
An ability to apply knowledge of basic science and engineering fundamentals
An ability to undertake problem identification, formulation and solution
The capacity to solve problems, including the collection and evaluation of information
The capacity for critical and independent thought and reflection
An expectation of the need to undertake lifelong learning, and the capacity to do so.
