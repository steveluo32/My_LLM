OverviewAvailabilitySemester 2FeesLook up feesAIMS 
From self-driving cars to automatic processing of medical scans, vision is a key sensory modality for a variety of artificial intelligence tasks. However, extracting meaning from images poses various computational challenges. In this subject, students will learn the basic principles of image formation and computational methods for interpreting images. Students will develop an understanding of the standard frameworks used in computer vision algorithms and their applications in tasks such as object recognition, target detection, and three-dimensional reconstruction. The programming language used is Python.
INDICATIVE CONTENT 
Topics covered may include:

Basics of image formation
Illumination and reflectance models
Colour spaces
Feature detectors and descriptors
Stereo correspondence
Methods for recovering three-dimensional shape
Image segmentation
Categorical and instance-level recognition
Intended learning outcomes
On completion of this subject, students should be able to: 
Identify basic challenges involved in interpreting image data Understand and articulate the mathematical and/or algorithmic basis of common techniques used in computer vision Analyse, design, and implement relevant techniques in computer vision to given problems Undertake end-to-end research experiments, including evaluation with image datasets, including reporting resultsCommunicate technical solutions to computer vision problemsGeneric skillsAbility to undertake problem identification, formulation, and solutionAbility to utilise a systems approach to complex problems and to design and operational performance ability to manage information and documentationCapacity for creativity and innovationAbility to communicate effectively with both technical experts and the community at largeNext: Eligibility and requirementsLast updated: 30 May 2024
