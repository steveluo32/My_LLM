The aim of the subject is to give the students the knowledge and skills required to carry out real life software engineering projects. Students will work in large teams to develop a non-trivial software system for an external client using agile software engineering methods. Workshops are used to explore the application of advanced software engineering techniques to student projects and are drawn from topics in: analysis and modelling, product and project metrics, design and technologies, product testing and measurement and validation.
INDICATIVE CONTENT
Developing real-world software on time and under budget is a challenging task. Students will work in a team to solve a practical problem, applying sound engineering principles to the formulation and solution of their problem. Students will engage in the full software engineering life cycle from requirements engineering through to delivery, to develop a software solution for an external client.
This subject has been integrated with the Skills Towards Employment Program (STEP) and contains activities that can assist in the completion of the Engineering Practice Hurdle (EPH).Intended learning outcomesOn completion of this subject the student is expected to be able to:Perform all the steps necessary to develop a software system for a real-world application, including requirements analysis, design, implementation, testing and deployment. Design and apply software engineering processes appropriate to a specific problem and/or set of functional and non-functional requirements.Apply appropriate computing technology to the solution of complex problems in software engineering.Participate collaboratively in a large software development team including communication, management, and quality assurance, utilising a variety of software engineering processes.Interpret the needs of external stakeholders to develop quality requirement specifications, designs, and maintainable software.Generic skillsAbility to apply knowledge of science and engineering fundamentalsAbility to undertake problem identification, formulation, and solutionAbility to utilise a systems approach to complex problems and to design and operational performanceProficiency in software engineering designAbility to conduct an engineering projectAbility to manage information and documentationAbility to communicate effectively, with the engineering team and with the community at largeCapacity for creativity and innovationAbility to function effectively as an individual and in multidisciplinary and multicultural teams, as a team leader or manager as well as an effective team memberUnderstanding of professional and ethical responsibilities, and commitment to themNext: Eligibility and requirementsLast updated: 26 June 2024
