The syllabus will cover basic principles of quantum bits (qubits) and quantum logic operations, through to applications in communication, security, optimisation, finance and machine learning. In computer-based tutorials, students will learn quantum computer programming using a state-of-the-art simulation environment, and access online quantum computer systems where available. This subject will be taught by a multi-disciplinary teaching team from physics, mathematics, computer science and finance.Intended learning outcomesOn completion of this subject, students will be able to:Demonstrate  basic knowledge of quantum bits, quantum logic, and quantum algorithms underpinning further study in quantum computing and quantum programming.Demonstrate an ability to program quantum computers to perform simple logic tasks.Explain how quantum computers can be applied to problems in the context of mathematics, computing and finance.Describe at a high level the status of current quantum computer technology.Generic skillsProblem-solving skills: the ability to engage with unfamiliar problems and identify relevant solution strategies.Analytical skills: the ability to construct and express logical arguments and to work in abstract or general.Collaborative skills: the ability to work in a team in a computer-tutorial based environment.Time-management skills: the ability to meet regular deadlines.Next: Eligibility and requirementsLast updated: 28 May 2024
