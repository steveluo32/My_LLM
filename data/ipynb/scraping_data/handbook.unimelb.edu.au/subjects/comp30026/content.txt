Formal logic and discrete mathematics provide the theoretical foundations for computer science. This subject uses logic and discrete mathematics to model the science of computing. It provides a grounding in the theories of logic, sets, relations, functions, automata, formal languages, and computability, providing concepts that underpin virtually all the practical tools contributed by the discipline, for automated storage, retrieval, manipulation and communication of data.INDICATIVE CONTENT

Logic: Propositional and predicate logic, resolution proofs, mathematical proof
Discrete mathematics: Sets, functions, relations, order, well-foundedness, induction and recursion
Automata: Regular languages, finite-state automata, context-free grammars and languages, parsing
Computability briefly: Turing machines, computability, decidability

A functional programming language will be used to implement and illustrate concepts.Intended learning outcomesOn completion of this subject students are expected to be able to:Use propositional and predicate logic as tools to reason about non-trivial computational problemsExplain basic principles of mechanised reasoning, including resolution proof, and apply these to reason about computional problemsReason about properties of mathematical objects such as functions and relations, and apply them to computational problems Apply discrete mathematical techniques to problems in computer scienceSynthesise context-free grammars from less formal language specificationsDesign abstract computational devices, such as finite-state automata and pushdown automataAnalyse and reason about computational models, including finite-state automata, pushdown automata and Turing machinesGeneric skillsOn completion of this subject students should have developed the following skills:Analytical skillsReasoning and problem-solving skillsAbility to communicate with precision, rigour and efficacyAbility to apply knowledge of science and engineering fundamentalsCapacity for creativity and innovationAbility to undertake problem identification, formulation and solutionNext: Eligibility and requirementsLast updated: 9 July 2024
