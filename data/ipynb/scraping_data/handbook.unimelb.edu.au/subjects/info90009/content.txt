This subject gives students in the Human-Computer Interaction specialisation of the Master of Information Technology practical experience with the User Experience (UX) Design process. Students will take what they learned about fieldwork, prototyping, and evaluation, and apply it in a hands-on, industry-driven, UX project. 


You will be responsible for identifying and learning about potential stakeholders, exploring a range of design opportunities, and evaluating the success of your ideas. Along the way, you will produce relevant deliverables that support your project, communicate your ideas, and demonstrate your skills. At the end of the project, you will produce a portfolio of your work that you can use when applying for jobs and speaking to potential clients.  


From a brief, you will deconstruct and understand the scope of a client's idea. You will need to identify who their potential users are, how they currently solve similar problems, and what their expectations, challenges, and frustrations are. You will use data collection skills to capture the nuance of your different users and develop high-level requirements for the project. Next, you'll need to translate these requirements into initial sketches and subsequent high-fidelity prototypes (using industry standard tools). These prototypes will need to demonstrate how your ideas work and communicate the experience your users should expect. Finally, you will evaluate your prototypes, working with users to understand the opportunities and limitations of your design ideas. The deliverables you develop throughout this project, will form the foundations for your portfolio, where you concisely present your work, your learnings, and your reflections, to convince future employers that they should hire you. 
Intended learning outcomesOn successful completion of this subject, students should be able to:Conduct fieldwork to understand users' requirementsDevelop prototypes of interface ideas at different levels of fidelity Evaluate the user experience of an interface prototype Visually communicate the process and outcomes of a user experience design projectNext: Eligibility and requirementsLast updated: 21 June 2024
