Interaction is no longer limited to desktop computers, windows-based interfaces, or keyboards and mice. Interfaces now include tangible communication, mobile and ubiquitous devices, ambient displays and sensing in public spaces. Novel interactions require specific methods to enable their conception, design, evaluation and use in creating interactive systems. This subject will introduce a selection of different interaction media and examine the specific methods used to create interactive systems with them. Underlying these specific methods are general conceptual approaches to design that are focussed on innovative or disruptive interactions between users and technology. Case studies will cover both fundamental research and industrial design practice. An emphasis is placed on developing the skills to critique and adapt different interface technologies and paradigms, to develop prototype systems, and evaluate new interactions to ensure that they meet their intended goals.
This subject follows a flipped classroom model. This means that the lectures are delivered online and class time is used for practical activities and active learning tasks.Intended learning outcomesOn successful completion of this subject, students should be able to:Demonstrate the ability to choose between different novel interaction technologies based on their design characteristicsGain a critical understanding of design approaches used for the development of interactive systemsDemonstrate the ability to design and develop prototype interactions that use novel interface technologies Demonstrate the ability to use iteration and results of formative evaluation to re-design interactionsNext: Eligibility and requirementsLast updated: 20 June 2024
