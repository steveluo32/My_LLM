The complex behaviours exhibited by many biological, social and technological systems - such as epidemics, urban systems and robotics - challenge our ability to predict, analyse and design such systems. Building computational models of these systems can help us better understand their structure and behaviour, and make better decisions about their design and control. 
The aim of this subject is to provide students with a solid foundation in the conceptual and technical skills required to design, implement and evaluate computational models of complex systems. 
INDICATIVE CONTENT
Topics covered will be selected from:

the use of models for science, engineering and policy
dynamical systems analysis
complexity and emergent behaviour
agent-based models
design, communication and evaluation of models
analysis and visualisation of model behaviour
case study exemplars of specific types of models, such as:



spatial models (eg, transportation)
network models (eg, epidemics)
adaptive models (eg, robotics)

Intended learning outcomesOn completion of this project, the student is expected to be able to:
Identify and abstract the key features of complex systems from a variety of domainsUnderstand the theoretical basis underpinning the analysis of complex systemsEvaluate and select, amongst different modelling techniques, the most appropriate for analysing specific systemsCreate computational models to analyse the behaviour of complex systems.Generic skillsAbility to undertake problem identification, formulation and solutionCapacity for independent critical analysis and problem-solving, including engaging with unfamiliar problems and identifying relevant strategiesAbility to analyse models, and self-directed research for modelling approachesIntellectual curiosity and creativity, including the ability to construct and express logical arguments and to work in abstract or general terms to increase the clarity and efficiency a model-based analysis.Openness to new ideas and unconventional critiques of received wisdomNext: Eligibility and requirementsLast updated: 30 May 2024
