 OverviewAvailabilitySemester 2FeesLook up feesAIMS
Programmers can choose between several representations of data. These will have different strengths and weaknesses, and each will require its own set of algorithms. Students will be introduced to the most frequently used data structures and their associated algorithms. The emphasis will be on justification of algorithm correctness, on analysis of algorithm performance, and on choosing the right data structure for the problem at hand. Leading up to an exam with a programming component, quality implementation of algorithms and data structures is emphasized.
This subject, or its cognate COMP20007 Design of Algorithms, is a prerequisite for many 300-level subjects in the Computing and Software Systems major.
 
INDICATIVE CONTENT
Topics include: justification of algorithm correctness; asymptotic and empirical analysis of algorithm performance; algorithms for sorting and searching, including fundamental data structures such as trees and hash tables; and graph algorithms.
