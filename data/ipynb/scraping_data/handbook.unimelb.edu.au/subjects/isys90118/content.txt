This subject will cover some of these essential skills such as carrying out critical literature review, designing research questions and methodologies, and comparing different approaches that are appropriate for primary research or development. Research skills are also essential for IS development projects, particularly in the requirements analysis and planning stages of development.
Research is a systematic process of answering questions to acquire new knowledge. Research in information systems questions how professional practice is conducted and contributes to the development of better practices. The subject provides students with coverage of how research is conducted within information systems, and how to critically assess published research and current practitioner knowledge. Topics covered include the nature of research, research design, approaches to development, theory and research, research paradigms: positivist, interpretivist and critical research approaches, quantitative and qualitative methodologies, and experimental research.
