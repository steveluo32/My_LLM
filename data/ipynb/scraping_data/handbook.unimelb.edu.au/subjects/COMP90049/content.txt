Machine Learning is the study of making accurate, computationally efficient, interpretable and robust inferences from data, often drawing on principles from statistics. This subject aims to introduce students to the intellectual foundations of machine learning, including the mathematical principles of learning from data, algorithms and data structures for machine learning, and practical skills of data analysis.
INDICATIVE CONTENT
Indicative content includes: cleaning and normalising data, supervised learning (classification, regression, linear & non-linear models), and unsupervised learning (clustering), and mathematical foundations for a career in machine learning.Intended learning outcomesOn completion of this subject students are expected to be able to:ILO 1 - Apply elementary mathematical concepts used in machine learningILO 2 - Derive machine learning models from first principlesILO 3 - Design, implement, and evaluate machine learning systems for real-world problemsILO 4 - Identify the correct machine learning model for a given real-world problemGeneric skillsOn completion of this subject, students should have the following generic skills:General skills include the ability to undertake problem identification, formulation, and developing solutions especially exploiting acquired dataIn addition this subject exposes students to use various data processing tools and make them learn integration of these tools to build more complex software systemsAs a result the student will develop skills to utilise a systems approach to complex problemsNext: Eligibility and requirementsLast updated: 12 July 2024
