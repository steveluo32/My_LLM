Spatial information is answering ‘where’ and ‘when’ questions – which are fundamental in decision making in complex systems, be it in urban planning, traffic and infrastructure management, environmental management, public health and sustainability, or any other social, economic, and environmental context.
The subject introduces foundations of effective, efficient, and large-scale spatial data management. This subject will cover the concepts, methods, and approaches that allow for efficient representation, querying, and retrieval of spatial data, in a modern ecosystem of spatial databases interfacing a geographic information system.
The knowledge acquired is fundamental for subsequent studies in spatial data analytics and visualisation, and is of particular relevance to people wishing to establish a career in the spatial information, the environmental, or the planning industry. It is also suited for every postgraduate student who is looking for solid skills with Geographic Information Systems.
In this subject, we will discuss the intricacies of computational representation and management of spatial information. The subject takes a spatial database perspective to management of extensive spatial datasets. The subject will cover the modelling, loading, transformation, analysis, and retrieval of spatial data in spatial databases. The subject covers data representations (vector, raster, and network data); spatial operations, including geometric, topological, set-oriented, and network operations; spatial indexes and access methods, including quadtrees and R-trees. The subject exposes the students to the whole lifecycle of spatial data management in a team-based project.Intended learning outcomesOn completion of this subject, students should be able to:Associate the value of spatial information to digital infrastructure management; Evaluate fundamental data structures and analysis procedures associated with spatial information; Apply the database design process to manage information about infrastructure data; Combine advanced skills in the design and use of a spatial database supported by a Geographic Information System on a complex infrastructure project; Demonstrate professional skills in ethics and sustainability, communication, and teamwork.Generic skillsOn successful completion, students will have:

The ability to transfer domain knowledge to fundamental challenges in society 

The ability to undertake problem identification, formulation, and solution
The ability to communicate effectively, with a project team and with the community at large
The ability to effectively manage information and documentation
An understanding of professional and ethical responsibilities, and a commitment to them

A capacity for lifelong learning and professional development.
