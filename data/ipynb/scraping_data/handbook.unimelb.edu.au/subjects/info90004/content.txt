UX is widely recognised as a major determinant of successful technology outcomes, and it provides the design inspiration behind some of the most successful innovations in digital technologies that define the present era. This subject concerns the methods and techniques that are used to identify what characterises UX and how you can recognise, measure and evaluate it in a variety of contexts. This entails a deep understanding of the psychological and social theories underlying UX, combined with practical knowledge of the various industry methods and tools currently in use. In terms of practice, an emphasis is placed on learning the skills needed to design, justify and conduct appropriate evaluations, and the interpretation of findings. In terms of theory, special emphasis is placed on how to identify and evaluate the various facets of UX, across a range of social and work-based settings, and across a range of technologies.Intended learning outcomesOn successful completion of this subject, students should be able to:Choose appropriate technology evaluation methods for a given problem, and critique this choice in terms of the advantages and disadvantagesUnderstand the different types of data for UX evaluation and how to interpret them, including field observations, interviews, automated use-logs, measurements of errors and efficacyApply knowledge of the contemporary tools and environments (including those of the industry-standard usability-testing laboratory) for the purpose of evaluating interactive systems Analyse and interpret evaluation data to inform further design and developmentNext: Eligibility and requirementsLast updated: 20 June 2024
