Statistics (MAST20005)Undergraduate level 2Points: 12.5On Campus (Parkville)You’re viewing the 2024 Handbook: 20242023202220212020201920182017Or view archived HandbooksView full page About this subject OverviewEligibility and requirementsAssessmentDates and timesFurther informationTimetable (login required)(opens in new window)Contact informationSummer Term liuhua.peng@unimelb.edu.auSemester 2 rjmail@unimelb.edu.auOverviewAvailabilitySummer TermSemester 2FeesLook up feesThis subject introduces the basic elements of statistical modelling, computation and data analysis. It is an entry point to further study of both mathematical and applied statistics, as well as broader data science.
Students will develop the ability to fit statistical models to data, estimate parameters of interest and test hypotheses. Both classical and Bayesian approaches will be covered. The importance of the underlying mathematical theory of statistics and the use of modern statistical software will be emphasised.
Concepts covered include: descriptive statistics, random sample, statistical inference, point estimation, interval estimation, properties of estimators, maximum likelihood, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing and Bayesian inference. Applications covered include: exploratory data analysis, inference for samples from univariate distributions, simple linear regression, correlation, goodness-of-fit tests and analysis of variance.Intended learning outcomesStudents completing this subject should be able to:Demonstrate an understanding of the basic ideas of estimation and hypothesis testing;Carry out many standard statistical procedures using a statistical computing package;Fit statistical models to data by both estimating and testing hypotheses about model parameters.Generic skillsIn addition to learning specific skills that will assist students in their future careers in science, they should progressively acquire generic skills from this subject that will assist them in any future career path.  These include:Problem-solving skills: the ability to engage with unfamiliar problems and identify relevant solution strategies;Analytical skills: the ability to construct and express logical arguments and to work in abstract or general terms to increase the clarity and efficiency of analysis;Collaborative skills: the ability to work in a team;Time management skills: the ability to meet regular deadlines while balancing competing commitments;Computer skills: the ability to use statistical computing packages.Next: Eligibility and requirementsLast updated: 8 August 2024
