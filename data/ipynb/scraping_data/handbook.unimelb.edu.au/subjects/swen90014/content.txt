This subject gives students in the Master of Engineering (Software) their first experience in analysing, designing, implementing, managing and delivering a small software engineering project. The aim of the subject is to give students an understanding of the major phases of software development, what each phase requires and how that phase fits into the overall engineering process. The subject also aims to give students an understanding of the importance of analysis, design, quality assurance activities and management activities within a software engineering process and to underpin the practical aspects of the management, analysis, design and validation subjects within the degree.
INDICATIVE CONTENT
Students will work in teams to conceive, analyse, design, implement and test a non-trivial software system for an external client. A key part of the project is for students to develop and manage a repeatable process in order to deliver a quality software product Workshops will explore the application of theory to your project and include selected topics drawn from: requirements analysis, design, implementation, testing and software project management relevant to the phase of the project that students are currently working on.
This subject has been integrated with the Skills Towards Employment Program (STEP) and contains activities that can assist in the completion of the Engineering Practice Hurdle (EPH).
 Intended learning outcomesHaving completed this unit the student is expected to:Be able to design and manage a repeatable process to achieve specific project goalsBe able to apply software engineering principles and techniques to the development of a non-trivial software systemWork with external stakeholders to develop software systems to meet stakeholder needsIntegrate the knowledge gained in other subjects in the solution of a real world problemGeneric skillsOn completion of the subject the student should have the following skills:
Ability to apply knowledge of science and software engineering fundamentals
