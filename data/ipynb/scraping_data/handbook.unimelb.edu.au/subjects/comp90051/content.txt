With exponential increases in the amount of data becoming available in fields such as finance and biology, and on the web, there is an ever-greater need for methods to detect interesting patterns in that data, and classify novel data points based on curated data sets. Learning techniques provide the means to perform this analysis automatically, and in doing so to enhance understanding of general processes or to predict future events.
Topics covered will include: supervised learning, semi-supervised and active learning, unsupervised learning, kernel methods, probabilistic graphical models, classifier combination, neural networks.
This subject is intended to introduce graduate students to machine learning though a mixture of theoretical methods and hands-on practical experience in applying those methods to real-world problems.
INDICATIVE CONTENT 
Topics covered will include: linear models, support vector machines, random forests, AdaBoost, stacking, query-by-committee, multiview learning, deep neural networks, un/directed probabilistic graphical models (Bayes nets and Markov random fields), hidden Markov models, principal components analysis, kernel methods.Intended learning outcomesOn completion of this subject the student is expected to:
Describe a range of machine learning algorithmsDesign, implement and evaluate learning systems to solve real-world problems, based on an appreciation of their relative suitability to different tasksGeneric skillsOn completion of the subject students should have the following skills:
Ability to undertake problem identification, formulation, and solution
Ability to utilise a systems approach to complex problems and to design and operational performance ability to manage information and documentation
Capacity for creativity and innovation
Ability to communicate effectively both with the engineering team and the community at large
