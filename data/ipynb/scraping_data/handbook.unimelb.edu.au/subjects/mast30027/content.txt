This subject considers the computational techniques required for the practical implementation of statistical theory, and includes Bayes and Monte-Carlo methods. The subject focuses on the application of these techniques to generalised linear models, which are commonly used in the analysis of categorical data.Intended learning outcomesAt the completion of the subject, students should:Explain the theory and applications of various mainstream applied statistical methods;Apply appropriate statistical methods to develop effective models or inferential procedures and provide sound interpretations for real-world data analysis;Perform statistical computation and data analysis using a computer package.Generic skillsIn addition to learning specific skills that will assist students in their future careers in science, they will have the opportunity to develop generic skills that will assist them in any future career path. These includeproblem-solving skills: the ability to engage with unfamiliar problems and identify relevant solution strategies;analytical skills: the ability to construct andexpress logical arguments and to work in abstract or general terms to increase the clarity and efficiency of analysis;collaborative skills: the ability to work in a team;time management skills: the ability to meet regular deadlines while balancing competing commitments;computer skills: the ability to use statistical computing packages.Next: Eligibility and requirementsLast updated: 6 August 2024
