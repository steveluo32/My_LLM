Solving problems in areas such as business, biology, physics, chemistry, engineering, humanities, and social sciences often requires manipulating, analysing, and visualising data through computer programming. This subject teaches students with little or no background in computer programming how to design and write basic programs using a high-level procedural programming language, and to solve simple problems using these skills.
This subject is the first subject in the Computing & Software Systems and the Informatics majors, and introduces students to programming and the basics of algorithmic thinking.
INDICATIVE CONTENT
Fundamental programming constructs; fundamental data structures; abstraction; basic program structures; algorithmic problem solving, testing and debugging; introduction to the Web, multimedia and visualisation.
Examples of projects that students complete are:

A text analytics “library” consisting of a series of independent functions to calculate/extract different things given a document/document collection as input
A video recommender system, broken down into a series of functions
An AI player for an online card game, designed such that students play off against each other (and against the class) at the end of semester

Please view this video for further information: Foundations of ComputingIntended learning outcomesOn Completion of this subject,the student is expected to:Use the fundamental programming constructs (sequence, alternation, selection)Use the fundamental data structures (arrays, records, lists, associative arrays)Use abstraction constructs such as functionsUnderstand and employ some basic program structuresUnderstand and employ some basic algorithmic problem-solving techniquesRead, write, and debug simple, small programsGeneric skillsOn completion of this subject, students should have developed the following generic skills:
An ability to apply knowledge of basic science and engineering fundamentals
An ability to undertake problem identification, formulation and solution
The capacity to solve problems, including the collection and evaluation of information
The capacity for critical and independent thought and reflection
An expectation of the need to undertake lifelong learning, and the capacity to do so
