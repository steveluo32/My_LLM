In many projects, it is important for programmers to have fine control over low-level details of program execution, and to be able to assess the cost of a design decision on likely overall program performance. This subject introduces students to a system programming language that gives programmers this kind of control, explores a range of standard data structures and algorithmic techniques, and shows how to apply them to frequently encountered problems.
INDICATIVE CONTENT

Introduction to computer organization
Machine level representation of data
Programming in a system programming language
Pointers and dynamic memory allocation
Program semantics and arguments about correctness
Induction and recursion
Basic searching algorithms (linear and binary)
String algorithms (such as KMP, BMH, and index-based techniques)
Basic sorting algorithms (such as selection sort, insertion sort, quicksort)
Basic data structures (such as binary search trees and hash tables)
Asymptotic complexity
Standard software development tools such as debuggers.

 Intended learning outcomesINTENDED LEARNING OUTCOMES (ILO) 
 
On completion of this subject the student is expected to:
Read, write and debug typical small-scale programs in a system programming language such as CDiscuss, analyse, implement, and apply standard data structures such as linked lists, binary search trees, and hash tablesDiscuss, analyse, and apply a range of sorting and searching algorithmsPresent logical arguments for the correctness of a given algorithmChoose between different algorithms for simple problems by analysing their complexityUse a command line interface and standard development tools for programmingGeneric skillsOn completion of this subject students should have developed the following skills:
Ability to undertake problem identification, formulation and solution
Capacity for independent critical thought, rational inquiry and self-directed learning
Profound respect for truth and intellectual integrity, and for the ethics of scholarship
An ability to apply knowledge of basic science and engineering fundamentals.
